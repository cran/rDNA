      <text>Testimony at hearing on Powerplant multipollutant legislation before Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate Change and Nuclear Energy on May 8, 2003

Introduction Thank you Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee for the opportunity to testifY today. My name is Joel Bluestein and I am the President of Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc. EEA is located in Arlington, Virginia and has been providing energy and environmental consulting services since 1974. Among our major areas of expertise are: Analyzing and forecasting the supply, demand and price of natural gas • Analyzing the impacts of regulatory policy on energy markets • Analyzing new energy technologies in the context of environmental regulations. We have done this work for natural gas producers, pipelines, local distribution companies, power generators, technology developers, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other public, private and institutional clients. I have been at EEA for 14 years and have over 20 years of experience in the energy and environmental field. Today I'd like to briefly share with you our current outlook on supply and price of natural gas in North America and some views on the relationship between that outlook and multipollutant legislation.

Gas Price Forecast EEA quarterly prepares a 20 year forecast ofNorth American natural gas supply, demand and price that we call our Natural Gas Compass. Figure I summarizes our current view of the price for natural gas over that period. It shows that we expect gas prices at the Henry Hub to average about $5.70/MMBtu (in constant 2002 dollars) for the next two years and decline to a level around $4.50/MMBtu for the remainder ofthe period except for brief periods later in the forecast. This is a significant increase from gas prices over the last 15 years, which have mostly stayed below $2.50IMMBtu. The roots of this change have been quite visible in the last few years and reflect the end of the gas bubble of the 1990s or more precisely the fact that the balance of supply and demand for natural gas has been growing tighter in recent years. A tighter balance between supply and demand results in higher prices and increased volatility. This does not mean that we are running out of natural gas, it does mean that gas producers need to look further afield and spend more money to meet the demand for gas, and that is reflected in the price. Our forecast includes new development of natural gas in several U.S. areas including Alaska, the deep Gulf of Mexico and the Rockies as well as imports from the Mackenzie Delta in Western Canada and the Maritimes area off of Canada's east coast. We also project increased imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) through the four existing LNG terminals and the addition of several new LNG terminals in the later part of the forecast. Finally, we project that adequate pipeline capacity must be constructed to bring the gas to places where it is needed. This scenario reflects what we see as a realistic though challenging period of growth for the natural gas industry. It requires very large investments of capital, though not more than has been invested in the past. It also requires a variety of positive policy decisions such as support for an Alaskan gas pipeline, development ofLNG terminals, construction of other new pipelines, etc. If any of these does not occur, the price forecast is higher. One might say that there is more upside potential than downside on gas prices. This price forecast is driven by the consumption of natural gas growing from 22.3 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) in 2002 to 28.2 Tcfin 2015 and 30.4 Tcfin 2020. The largest portion of this growth is in the power generation sector, growing from 4.3 Tcf in 2002 to 8.4 Tcf in 2015 and 9.5 Tcf in 2020. While there is some variation, these consumption projections are not significantly different from those developed by other forecasters, including the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

So I agree with the basics of much of what has been said on this topic: • The gas supply/demand balance has gotten tighter and will remain tight. • Gas prices will be higher than in recent history, perhaps significantly higher. • Power generation will be the major growth sector for gas demand. Relationship to MultipoUutant Regulation The question of how we can best and most appropriately ensure an adequate gas supply is a complex and important one that is already being addressed in other forums. I think the question for today is: What does this gas price outlook say about environmental regulation of the power generation sector? The EEA forecast does not include any significant switching from coal to gas in the power generation sector. We do include the large amount of new gas-fired generation that has been built in recent years, about ISO GW from 1998 through 2002, and continued construction of new gas capacity in the near future. We also project new coal capacity coming on line, mostly after 2010. It must be pointed out that, in certain areas, this new gas capacity actually reduces gas consumption by replacing older, less efficient gas generation. We have seen old gas plants retired in Texas because they cannot compete with the new, more efficient gas plants. It's been estimated that replacing all of the old gas plants in Texas with new, state-of-the-art gas combined cycle plants could reduce gas consumption for power generation by over 200 Bcfper year. The use of even more efficient combined heat and power (CHP)can make this reduction even greater. The same is true in other parts of the Southwest, as well as parts of the West, South and Northeast. In some states where markets have not opened up yet, this potential is currently being lost because incumbent utilities can choose to dispatch their old less efficient plants rather than the new plants. There seems to be a lot of concern that, either on its own or due to various environmental restrictions, the demand for gas for power generation will inexorably grow until it threatens our economy. I think this concern is overstated and unfounded, certainly as regards the power generation sector. Although we see continued growth in new gas-fired generation, we do not expect massive switching from coal to gas under any 3-P regulatory scenario currently being discussed. At the gas prices we are forecasting, switching to gas will not be the most economic choice except for the least economic, highest cost-of-control coal plants. The capital cost of a new combined cycle plant is much less than a new coal plant, but still much more than the cost of even a complicated control retrofit at most coal plants. And then, the cost of fuel for even an efficient new combined cycle gas plant at $4.50/MMBtu is over $30/MWh. This is almost three times the fuel cost for even an inefficient coal plant burning coal at $1/MMBtu or less. There is a lot of money to be made on the coal side of that competition. This is reflected in the U.S. EPA's extensive modeling of regulatory scenarios in which they are hard-pressed to show any significant switching to gas even with gas prices two or three times lower than the prices we are forecasting. The higher gas prices go, the better the economics of coal look. We might have greater concern over switching if there were no way to burn coal efficiently and cleanly. But this is not the case. There are many coal plants today that efficiently and economically limit their S02 and NOx emissions and are highly competitive in the market. New coal plants being built are even cleaner. New coal technologies being developed, such as integrated gasification combined cycle plants, are cleaner and more efficient yet. New technology is vital to addressing control additional pollutants such as mercury or even CO2 . The concern then becomes whether the appropriate technologies will be available to provide adequate reductions. In the history of pollution control programs, industry has always found ways to control pollution more effectively and less expensively than originally thought possible. But that may be little comfort to plant owners who face a new set of pollution control challenges. Multipollutant programs like the Clear Skies Act and those proposed by Senator Jeffords and Senators Carper, Chafee and Gregg, despite differences in detail which I don't propose to address, all will likely help the development of new, clean coal generation by providing increased regulatory certainty and flexibility to find effective compliance solutions. Emission cap and trade programs provide a variety of tools to address the problem, including: the timing and stringency of the cap, cost mitigation measures and availability of off-sector trading. One shortcoming of the Clear Skies Act in supporting new technology is that the grandfathering approach to allowance allocation disadvantages new plants in general and new coal plants in particular. The failure to allocate allowances to new coal plants creates a disincentive for companies to develop these plants and drives the power sector more towards gas. An allocation approach that includes new plants and rewards efficiency is one way to help ensure that we can continue to rely on our substantial coal resources. I agree with those who endorse phased implementation of emission caps. However, I would add that starting the programs earlier and phasing them in more gradually is critical to ensuring the availability of appropriate technology. Development of new technology requires a driver, which in this case is regulation. Then technology development needs money and time for research, development and commercialization. Command and control programs and cap and trade programs with large reduction steps don't provide enough time for technology development. However, delaying the imposition of the regulation doesn't provide a sufficient driver for development. A series of gradual steps can jump-start technology development and keep it moving. This can be illustrated for the topic that probably creates the greatest concern for over-reliance on natural gas - C02 reduction. I think it's clear that switching to gas alone is not an adequate approach to C02 mitigation. CO2reduction will require a mix of gas, renewable, and advanced coal technologies such as integrated gasification combined cycle with sequestration or coalbased hydrogen production, combined heat and power and other efficiency measures. Overly aggressive near-term reduction requirements will not help us promote the development ofnew technologies. On the other hand, neither will continued delay of regulation. The point was made at the last hearing on this topic that delay in addressing C02 regulation is one more reason that companies are reluctant to construct new coal capacity today. Finally, the long-term reduction goals required to address climate change are much greater than the levels currently being discussed even in 4-P legislation and must be recognized early to provide the right direction. Figure 2 shows a cap and trade approach that applies gradual CO2reductions to jump-start technology development and promote long-term solutions while avoiding near-term economic disruption, including excessive switching to gas. In fact, in this approach, the emission cap increases for the first several years, then levels off and begins a very gradual decline. It is designed to reach an 80 percent CO2reduction by 2060, which is calibrated to meeting a 450 part per million (ppm) atmospheric C02 level. An economic circuit breaker could be used during the declining portion of the program to adjust the rate of decline and avoid economic disruptions.</text>

      <text>OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GEORGE V. VOINOVICH, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OHIO

Senator Voinovich. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing. I am pleased to be here today for our second meeting this year and our 24th hearing since 1998 on multi- emissions issues. Today, we are here to discuss the Clear Skies Act, and I am sure that Mr. Connaughton will do a good job of outlining the fact that this will reduce power emissions by 70 percent. The beauty of Clear Skies is that the reduction levels and timelines are placed in statute and cannot be delayed. The bill expands the Acid Rain Program, our Nation's most successful clean air initiative, which has had virtually no litigation, 100 percent compliance, and reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 38 percent below 1990 levels at less than the projected costs. As I discussed at our last hearing, it is important we put multi-emission legislation in context. We live in a global marketplace. Let us not fool ourselves, environmental and energy policies have a direct impact on our ability to keep and maintain jobs in this Country. Just ask the thousands of Ohioans who are in manufacturing who are no longer working. We simply cannot continue to rely on natural gas for power generation. Our clean air policies have played a major role in the fact that nearly 88 percent of the new power plants built since 1992 have been natural gas fired. We have a chart here that shows how natural gas costs have increased dramatically during the last several years. [See chart on page 35.] The chemical industry, which is very big in the State of Ohio, at one time was an exporter of products. Today, we have a 9.6 billion deficit. That means that we have gone from a Country that exports chemical products to now that has changed and now we are importing those products. Annual funding for the Lehigh Program, a program for low- income families, has increased 73 percent since 1999 because of higher heating prices. This legislation is also needed now because 509 counties were recently designated as non-attainment for the new National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter. This is a very serious problem in terms of job growth and capital investment. Chart 2 will show that under Clear Skies and EPA's new diesel fuel and engine regulations to reduce sulfur, 90 percent of the counties would come into attainment without any local effort. So we have the counties that are not in attainment. With Clear Skies and the new diesel, you see from that chart that most of them are going to come into compliance because of Clear Skies and the new diesel requirements. These designations are based on stricter standards, not dirtier air. [See chart on page 36.] I think a lot of people are under the impression that the air is dirtier today. It is much cleaner than it was. Since 1970, while our Nation and economy have grown substantially, emissions of the six main pollutants have decreased by 50 percent. We need Clear Skies to continue at a higher rate this Country's commitment to cleaning up the environment and protecting public health. You can just see our economy has grown, number of miles traveled, more people in this Country, and even during that period we have reduced the six worse toxins by over 50 percent. The Clean Air Act's highly litigated and cumbersome provisions make it unclear what or when reductions will be achieved. Critics of Clear Skies point to the section 126 petition, NAAQS, and New Source Review program as affected, but history tells a different story. For example, chart 4. This chart shows the timeline for when EPA began considering a new standard for ozone and when State implementation plans are due. Folks, it took 15 years, 15 years to get the new ozone standards that are now for ozone and particulate matter. [See chart on page 37.] The New Source Review program is far worse. I will quickly run through some of it. Twenty pages of regulations in 1980 defining NCRs turned into 4,000 pages of guidance documents. A 1990 lawsuit and court decision resulted in EPA rulemaking. In 1992 working groups were formed to reform New Source Review, with contradictory proposed changes in 1996 and 1998. EPA filed enforcement actions in 1999, of which several are still being litigated and different courts have reached different opinions in two of these cases. On top of this, critics have taken out of context two sections of a 208 National Academy of Science interim report to claim that New Source Review, if unchanged, will result in more reductions than Clear Skies. This is absolutely ridiculous. Clear Skies cap all power pollution immediately, while NSR is applied on a case-by-case basis under a standard that now has two different and litigated interpretations. With all this lengthy litigation, no one really can tell us when the NSR program is going to really take effect. It won't be until 2007 before you have oral arguments on two different cases on NSR. One says that the rule is OK, it complies with the law; the other one says it doesn't comply with the law. So that is what we get from NSR: More lawyers, more litigation. Until we get passed this rhetoric of the false charges that Clear Skies is less than existing law, we are going to go nowhere. Time is of the essence. If we continue the way we are, folks, we are going to have a stalemate of losses, uncertainty for jobs and our competitive position in the global marketplace, and, more importantly, more importantly, for those of us who are concerned about the environment, uncertainty for our environment and for public health in this Country. [The prepared statement of Senator Voinovich follows:]

Statement of Hon. George V. Voinovich, U.S. Senator from the State of Ohio

Good morning. I am pleased to be here today for our second meeting this year and our 24th hearing since 1998 on multi-emissions issues. Today we are here to discuss the Clear Skies Act, which would be the most aggressive clean air proposal ever enacted a 70 percent reduction of power plant emissions. In just 3 years, nitrogen oxides would be capped at a reduction level of 59 percent and in 5 years, at a 59 percent reduction level for sulfur dioxide and 29 percent for mercury. As former EPA Administrator Leavitt stated before my Subcommittee on April 1 of last year, the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides reductions ``will result in some $50 billion'' investment by power plants. The beauty of Clear Skies is that the reduction levels and timelines are placed in statute and cannot be delayed. The bill expands the Acid Rain Program our nation's most successful clean air initiative, which has had virtually no litigation, 100 percent compliance, and reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 38 percent below 1990 levels at less than the projected cost. As I discussed at our hearing last week, it is important that we put multi-emissions legislation in context. We live in a global marketplace. Let us not fool ourselves environmental and energy policies have a direct impact on our ability to keep and maintain jobs in this country. We simply cannot continue to rely on natural gas for power generation. Our clean air policies have played a major role in the fact that nearly 88 percent of the new power plants built since 1992 have been natural gas fired. [CHART 1] As a result of this increased demand, natural gas prices have doubled their historical price and we now have the highest prices in the developed world. As the second largest consumer of natural gas (quote): ``The chemical industry's eight-decade run as a major exporter (ended in 2003) with a $19 billion trade surplus in 1997 becoming a $9.6 billion deficit'' (March 17, 2004 Washington Post article). Tom Mullen from Cleveland Catholic Charities testified in 2002 that we must also consider the devastating impact of increased electricity and home heating costs on the poor and elderly. Annual funding for the LIHEAP program to help low income families with their home heating bills has increased by 73 percent since 1999 due to higher prices. Clear Skies will keep jobs in America and energy prices stable, by allowing us to keep using coal our most abundant and cheapest energy source. This legislation is needed now because 509 counties were recently designated as in nonattainment for the new National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter. As Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce President Michael Fisher stated in testimony on April 1, 2004, ``job growth and capital investment are hindered by the nonattainment designation.'' [CHART 2] Under Clear Skies and EPA's new diesel fuel and engine regulations to reduce sulfur, 90 percent of the counties would come into attainment without any local effort. These designations are based on stricter standards, not dirtier air. [CHART 3] Since 1970, while our nation and economy have grown substantially, emissions of the six main pollutants have decreased by 51 percent. We need Clear Skies to continue at a higher rate this country's commitment to cleaning up the environment and protecting public health. We all want cleaner air the important question is how we achieve it. Instead of having this debate, false claims are being made that existing programs are better than Clear Skies. Conrad Schneider from Clean Air Task Force testified last week that: (quote) ``. . . existing provisions of the Clean Air Act could potentially require future emission reductions beyond . . . '' Clear Skies. Could potentially require'? This is exactly the point. We need to stop talking about the ideal world and focus on the real world. The Clean Air Act's highly litigated and cumbersome provisions make it unclear what or when reductions will be achieved. Critics of Clear Skies point to the Section 126 petitions, NAAQS, and New Source Review programs as effective, but history tells us a different story: bullet In 1997, eight Northeastern states petitioned EPA to force Midwestern states to reduce nitrogen oxides. After four Federal court decisions and EPA retooling, this culminated in the NOx SIP call, which went into effect not in May 1998 but in May 2004 7 years after the process began. bullet [CHART 4] This chart shows the timeline for when EPA began considering a new standard for ozone and when State Implementation Plans are due. It took 15 years! bullet The New Source Review program is far worse. I will quickly run through some of it:

bullet 20-pages of regulations in 1980 defining NSR has turned into 4,000 pages of guidance documents; bullet A 1990 lawsuit and court decision resulted in an EPA rulemaking in 1992; bullet Working groups were formed in the 1990's to reform NSR with contradictory proposed changes in 1996 and 1998; bullet EPA filed enforcement actions in 1999 of which several are still being litigated and different courts have reached different opinions in two of the cases. bullet In 2003, EPA issued two rules to reform the program, both of which have spurred lawsuits. Oral arguments on one of these rules are not expected to occur until at least 2006. bullet On top of all this, critics have taken out of context two sentences of a 208 page National Academy of Sciences interim report to claim that the NSR program if unchanged will result in more reductions than Clear Skies. This is ridiculous. Clear Skies caps all power plant pollution immediately while NSR is applied on a case-by-case basis under a standard that now has two different--and litigated-- interpretations. With all this lengthy litigation, no one can really tell us what the NSR program will get us--except more lawyers!

Until we get past this rhetoric and the false charges that Clear Skies does less than existing law, we are going to go nowhere. In my opinion, these arguments are just a facade for the real motive of holding up this legislation for the political issue of capping carbon dioxide emissions which cannot pass the Senate and definitely not the House. This will leave us in this stalemate of lawsuits and uncertainty for businesses and more importantly uncertainty for our environment and public health. Time is of the essence. It is either now or never. I met with several of my colleagues on the other side and plan to keep working with them and every member on this Committee to get something done to reduce sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury emissions substantially. I look forward to hearing from the witnesses. Thank you.</text>

I. INTRODUCTION

Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee for the opportunity to speak with you today about the Clear Skies Act of 2003. Based on one of the most successful programs created by the Clean Air Act, Clear Skies is a proposal to substantially reduce emissions of the three most harmful pollutants from power generation--and to do so in a way that is much faster and more efficient than under current law. As President Bush said in the State of the Union Address, Clear Skies will advance our goal of ``promot[ing] energy independence for our country, while dramatically improving our environment.'' The Administration is committed to working with this Subcommittee and Congress to pass legislation this year. The widespread support for multi-pollutant legislation to reduce power plant emissions is a strong indicator that the time for action on this critical issue is now. Failure to enact Clear Skies this year will delay important public health and environmental benefits. This country should be very proud of the progress we have already made in cleaning up our air. Since the Clean Air Act was first enacted in 1970, we have reduced emissions of the six primary air pollutants by 25 percent. During the same time period, the economy has grown significantly--the Gross Domestic Product increased 160 percent; vehicle miles traveled increased 150 percent; energy consumption increased 40 percent; and the U.S. population increased 35 percent. Although we have made much progress since 1970, we still face major air quality challenges in many parts of the country. Clear Skies is the most important next step we can take to address these challenges and achieve healthy air and a clean environment for all Americans. Clear Skies would make great strides toward solving our remaining air quality problems in a way that also advances national energy security and promotes economic growth. It would reduce power plant emissions of SOINF2/INF, NOx and mercury by approximately 70 percent from today's levels and do it faster, with more certainty, and at less cost to American consumers than would current law. Last year's EPA estimates project that, over the next decade, all the programs of the existing Clean Air Act would reduce power plant emissions of SOINF2/INF and NOx by approximately 23 million tons. Over the same time period, Clear Skies would reduce emissions of these same pollutants by 58 million tons--a reduction of 35 million tons of pollution that will not be achieved under current law\1\. When fully implemented, Clear Skies would prolong thousands of lives each year, providing billions of dollars in economic benefits, save millions of dollars in health care costs, and increase by millions the number of people living in areas that meet our new, more stringent health-based national air quality standards. Clear Skies would also virtually eliminate chronic acidity in northeastern lakes, reduce nitrogen loading in coastal waters, and help restore visibility in our national parks. The Clean Air Act has been, and continues to be, a vehicle for great progress in improving the health and welfare of the American people. The Clear Skies Act substantially expands one of the most successful Clean Air Act programs--the Acid Rain Program--and reduces the need to rely on complex and less efficient programs. The result would be significant nationwide human health and environmental benefits; certainty for industry, states and citizens; energy security; and continuing low costs to consumers.

II. CLEAR SKIES PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS

The heart of Clear Skies is a proven cap-and-trade approach to emissions reductions. Mandatory caps restrict total emissions and decline over time. Clear Skies would continue the existing national cap-and-trade program for SOINF2/INF, but dramatically reduce the cap from 9 million to 3 million tons. Clear Skies would also use a national cap-and-trade program for mercury that would reduce emissions from the current level of about 48 tons to a cap of 15 tons, and would employ two regional cap-and-trade programs for NOx to reduce emissions from current levels of 5 million tons to 1.7 million tons. The specific caps and their timing are set forth in Table 1. Table 1. Clear Skies Emission Reductions Timetable Although national in scope, Clear Skies recognizes and adjusts for important regional differences in both the nature of air pollution and the relative importance of emissions from power generation. The eastern half of the country needs reductions in NOx emissions to help meet the ozone and fine particle standards, which generally are not an issue in the western half of the county (with the exception of California, which does not have significant emissions from existing coal-fired power plants). The western half of the country needs NOx reductions primarily to reduce the regional haze that mars scenic vistas in our national parks and wilderness areas, and the nitrogen deposition that harms fragile forests. Recognizing these regional differences, Clear Skies would establish two trading zones for NOx emissions and prohibit trading between the zones to ensure that the critical health-driven goals in the East are achieved. Clear Skies also recognizes the special visibility protection measures that have been developed by states participating in the Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP). Clear Skies would essentially codify the WRAP's separate SOINF2/INF backstop cap-and-trade program, which would come into effect only if the WRAP states did not meet their 2018 SOINF2/INF emissions targets. Finally, Clear Skies requires tough, technology-based new source standards on all new power generation projects and maintains special protections for national parks and wilderness areas when sources locate within 50 km of ``Class I'' national parks and wilderness areas. Significant Public Health and Environmental Benefits The public health and environmental benefits of Clear Skies present compelling reasons for its immediate passage. EPA projects that, by 2010, reductions in fine particle and ozone levels under Clear Skies would result in billions of dollars in health and visibility benefits nationwide each year, including as many as 6,400 prolonged lives. Using an alternative methodology, 3,800 lives would be prolonged by 2010. Under EPA's base methodology for calculating benefits, Americans would experience significant benefits each year by 2020, including: bullet 12,000 fewer premature deaths (7,000 under an alternative analysis), bullet 11,900 fewer visits to hospitals and emergency rooms for cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms, bullet 370,000 fewer days with asthma attacks, and bullet 2 million fewer lost work days. Using the alternative methodology, by 2020 Americans would experience 7,000 fewer premature deaths each year. Methodologies do not exist to quantify or monetize all the benefits of Clear Skies. Still, it is clear that the benefits far exceed the costs. EPA estimates that the health benefits we can quantify under Clear Skies are worth $93 billion annually by 2020--substantially greater than the annual costs of approximately $6.5 billion. An alternative approach projects annual health benefits of $11 billion, still significantly outweighing the costs. The Agency estimates an additional $3 billion in benefits from improving visibility at select National Parks and Wilderness Areas. These estimates do not include the many additional benefits that cannot currently be monetized but are likely to be significant, such as human health benefits from reduced risk of mercury emissions, and ecological benefits from improvements in the health of our forests, lakes, and coastal waters. Clear Skies would achieve most of these benefits by dramatically reducing fine particle pollution caused by SOINF2/INF and NOx emissions, which is a year-round problem. Of the many air pollutants regulated by EPA, fine particle pollution is perhaps the greatest threat to public health. Hundreds of studies in the peer reviewed literature have found that these microscopic particles can reach the deepest regions of the lungs. Exposure to fine particles is associated with premature death, as well as asthma attacks, chronic bronchitis, decreased lung function, and respiratory disease. Exposure is also associated with aggravation of heart and lung disease, leading to increased hospitalizations, emergency room and doctor visits, and use of medication. By reducing NOx emissions, Clear Skies also would reduce ozone pollution in the eastern part of the country and help keep ozone levels low in the western portion of the country. Ozone (smog) is a significant health concern, particularly for children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases who are active outdoors in the summertime. Ozone can exacerbate respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and pain when breathing deeply, as well as transient reductions in lung function and inflammation of the lung. Ozone has also been associated with increased hospitalizations and emergency room visits for respiratory causes. Repeated exposure over time may permanently damage lung tissue. Current estimates indicate that more than 350 counties fail to meet the health-based fine particle and ozone standards. As a result, 45 percent of all Americans live in counties where monitored air was unhealthy at times because of high levels of fine particles and ozone.\2\ Clear Skies, in combination with existing control programs, would dramatically reduce that number, as shown in Figure 1. In areas where attainment is not projected, Clear Skies would assist those areas in addressing the air quality problems. Even counties currently measuring attainment would benefit from the reductions under Clear Skies. Throughout the West, Clear Skies would hold emissions from power plants in check, preserving clean air in high-growth areas and preventing degradation of the environment, even as population and electricity demand increase. [See Attached Figure 1, Widespread Attainment with Fine Particle and Ozone Standards] Clear Skies would also reduce mercury emissions from power plants. EPA is required to regulate mercury because EPA determined that mercury emissions from power plants pose an otherwise unaddressed significant risk to health and the environment, and because control options to reduce this risk are available. Mercury, a potent toxin, can cause permanent damage to the brain and nervous system, particularly in developing fetuses when ingested in sufficient quantities. People are exposed to mercury mainly through eating fish contaminated with methylmercury. Mercury is released into the environment from many sources. Mercury emissions are a complex atmospheric pollutant transported over local, regional, national, and global geographic scales. EPA estimates that 60 percent of the mercury falling on the U.S. is coming from current man- made sources. Power generation remains the largest man-made source of mercury emissions in the United States. In 1999, coal-fired power plants emitted 48 tons of mercury (approximately 37 percent of man-made total). These sources also contribute 1 percent of mercury to the global pool. Mercury that ends up in fish may originate as emissions to the air. Mercury emissions are later converted into methylmercury by bacteria. Methylmercury accumulates through the food chain: fish that eat other fish can accumulate high levels of methylmercury. EPA has determined that children born to women who may have been exposed to high levels may be at some increased risk of potential adverse health effects. Prenatal exposure to such levels of methylmercury may cause developmental delays and cognitive impairment in children. Clear Skies will require a 69 percent reduction of mercury emissions from power plants. In addition to substantial human health benefits, Clear Skies would also deliver numerous environmental benefits. For example, under Clear Skies, we project that 10 million fewer pounds of nitrogen would enter the Chesapeake Bay annually by 2020, reducing potential for water quality problems such as algae blooms and fish kills. In fact, the Chesapeake Bay States, including NY, VA, MD, PA, DE, WV and DC, recently agreed to incorporate the nitrogen reductions that would result from Clear Skies legislation as part of their overall plan to reduce nutrient loadings to the Bay. Clear Skies would also accelerate the recovery process of acidic lakes, virtually eliminating chronic acidity in many Northeastern lakes. For decades fish in the Adirondacks have been decimated by acid rain, making many lakes completely incapable of supporting populations of fish such as trout and smallmouth bass. The Acid Rain Program has allowed some of these lakes and the surrounding forests to begin to recover; Clear Skies would achieve additional needed reductions. Clear Skies would also help other ecosystems suffering from the effects of acid deposition by preventing further deterioration of Southeastern streams. Finally, Clear Skies would improve visibility across the country, particularly in our treasured national parks and wilderness areas. Clear Skies is designed to ensure that these public health and environmental benefits are achieved and maintained. By relying on mandatory caps, Clear Skies would ensure that total power plant emissions of SOINF2/INF, NOx and mercury would not increase over time. This is a distinct advantage over traditional command-and-control regulatory methods that establish source-specific emission rates but which allow total emissions to increase over time. Like the Acid Rain Program, Clear Skies would have much higher levels of accountability and transparency than most other regulatory programs. Sources would be required to continuously monitor and report all emissions, ensuring accurate and complete emissions data. If power plants emit more than allowed, financial penalties are automatically levied--without the need for an enforcement action. More importantly, every ton emitted over the allowed amount would have to be offset in the following year, ensuring no net environmental harm. This high level of environmental assurance is rare in existing programs; Clear Skies would make it a hallmark of the next generation of environmental protection. Reasonable Costs and Energy Security for Consumers and Industry The President directed us to design Clear Skies to meet both our environmental and our energy goals. Under Clear Skies, electricity prices are expected to remain at or below current levels over the next decade. Our extensive economic modeling of the power industry looked at a broad array of factors to gauge the effects of Clear Skies on the energy industry--and they all show that cleaner air and energy security can go hand-in-hand. Clear Skies would maintain energy diversity. With Clear Skies, coal production for power generation would be able to grow by almost 10 percent from 2000 to 2020 while air emissions are significantly reduced. EPA's extensive economic modeling for Clear Skies demonstrates that the proposal's emission reductions would be achieved primarily through retrofitting controls on existing plants. Clear Skies's timeframe and certainty enable the power sector to meet aggressive emission reduction targets without fuel switching. This is important not only to power generators and their consumers who want to continue to rely on our most abundant, reliable, affordable and domestically secure source of energy, but also to other consumers and industries whose livelihoods could be hurt by a rise in natural gas prices. Our analysis shows that Clear Skies would not cause a significant increase in natural gas prices. Under Clear Skies by 2010, about three-fourths of U.S. coal-fired generation is projected to come from units with billions of dollars of investment in advanced SOINF2/INF and/or NOx control equipment (such as scrubbers and Selective Catalytic Reduction, which also substantially reduce mercury emissions). In 2020, the percentage is projected to rise to 85 percent. Cost effective strategies and technologies for the control of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions exist now, and--thanks in good part to the Clear Skies market-based system--improved methods for these pollutants, and for mercury, are expected to become increasingly cost-efficient over the next several years. In fact, the Institute of Clean Air Companies forecasts that the U.S. markets for most technology sectors will remain fairly strong, adding momentum to the air pollution control technology industry. We expect that the Clear Skies Act will provide great benefits to American jobs in the engineering and construction industries. One of the key reasons Clear Skies would be cost-effective is its reliance on cap-and-trade programs. Like the Acid Rain Program upon which it is based, Clear Skies would give industry flexibility in how to achieve the needed emission reductions, which allows industry to make the most cost-effective reductions and pass those savings on to consumers. Power plants would be allowed to choose the pollution reduction strategy that best meets their needs (e.g., installing pollution control equipment, switching to lower sulfur coals, buying excess allowances from plants that have reduced their emissions beyond required levels). Like the Acid Rain program, Clear Skies includes banking provisions, enabling companies to save unused allowances for future use. Banking creates a tangible, quantifiable, economic incentive to decrease emissions beyond allowable levels, which EPA projects will result in significant early benefits due to over- compliance in the initial years, particularly for SOINF2/INF. It also leads to gradual emissions reductions over time, and therefore a less disruptive transition to tighter emission controls needed to address lingering problems. Based on past experience under the Acid Rain Program, by placing a monetary value on avoided emissions, Clear Skies would stimulate technological innovation, including efficiency improvements in control technology, and encourage early reductions. Assistance to State and Local Governments Under the current Clean Air Act, state and local governments face the daunting task of meeting the new fine particle and ozone standards. Clear Skies would substantially reduce that burden. By making enormous strides toward attainment of the fine particle and ozone standards, Clear Skies would assist state and local governments in meeting their obligation under the Clean Air Act to bring areas into attainment with these health-based standards, and provide Americans with cleaner air. Clear Skies' assistance to states goes beyond ensuring that power plants will reduce their emissions. Clear Skies relies on a common- sense principle--if a local air quality problem will be solved in a reasonable timeframe by the required regional reductions in power plant emissions, we should not require local areas to adopt local measures. Under Clear Skies, areas that are projected to meet the ozone and fine particles standards by 2015 as a result of Clear Skies would have a legal deadline of 2015 for meeting these standards (i.e., will have an attainment date of 2015). These areas would be designated ``transitional'' areas, instead of ``nonattainment'' or ``attainment,'' and would not have to adopt local measures (except as necessary to qualify for transitional status). They would have reduced air quality planning obligations and would not have to administer more complex programs, such as transportation conformity, nonattainment New Source Review, or locally based progress or technology requirements in most circumstances.

III. IMPROVING THE CLEAN AIR ACT WITH CLEAR SKIES

Clear Skies would improve the Clean Air Act in a number of ways. It would build on the proven portions of the Clean Air Act--like the national ambient air quality standards and the Acid Rain Program--and reduce reliance on complex, less efficient requirements like New Source Review for existing sources. The mandatory emissions caps at the heart of Clear Skies guarantee that reductions will be achieved and maintained over time. In contrast, uncertainties with respect to regulatory development, litigation, and implementation time make it difficult to estimate how quickly and effectively current regulations would be implemented under the current Clean Air Act. The level of SOINF2/INF and NOx reductions we expect over the next decade with Clear Skies legislation could not be achieved under the existing Act. After that, we know that Clear Skies would achieve significant reductions, while both the timing and level of reductions under the current Clean Air Act are unclear. Early Reductions One of the major reasons we need Clear Skies now is that adoption of Clear Skies would provide greater protection over the next decade than the traditional regulatory path. The Clear Skies Act will result in significant over-compliance in the early years, particularly for SOINF2/INF, because sources are allowed to bank excess emissions reductions. For reasons described below, our analyses indicate that the cumulative SOINF2/INF and NOx emissions reductions achieved by Clear Skies over the next decade would not be achieved in the same timeframe under the current Clean Air Act. Last year's EPA estimates project that power plants would emit 35 million fewer tons of NOx and SOINF2/INF over the next decade under Clear Skies than they would under the current Clean Air Act--this more than doubles the reductions otherwise expected and would ensure significantly larger human health and environmental benefits. Our analysis suggests that the amount of pollution controls that the industry will have to install under Clear Skies over the next decade will stretch the limits of available labor and other construction resources, but can in fact be accomplished while maintaining energy reliability and continuing the downward trend in electricity prices.

Legislation Now Is Better than Regulation Followed by Years of Litigation Even if Clear Skies is not passed by Congress, power plants will be required to reduce their emissions of SOINF2/INF, NOx and mercury. There is no more cost effective way than Clear Skies to meet the requirements of the current Clean Air Act or to achieve our public health and environmental goals. We know that, absent new legislation, EPA and the states will need to take a number of regulatory actions, although it is unclear now when the requirements will come into effect or what their control levels will be. Clear Skies has several benefits over the regulatory scheme that will otherwise confront power generators. Clear Skies is designed to go into effect immediately upon enactment. Power plants would immediately understand their obligations to reduce pollution and would be rewarded for early action. As a result, public health and environmental benefits would begin immediately. Given Clear Skies' design, it is unlikely that litigation could delay the program (particularly since Congress would decide the two most controversial issues--the magnitude and timing of reductions). In contrast, under the current Clean Air Act, power plants would not know what their obligations would be until after EPA and states started and completed numerous rulemakings. Past experience suggests that litigation delays on the regulatory path are likely. Our experience with two cap-and-trade programs--the legislatively created Acid Rain Trading Program and the administratively created NOx SIP Call--illustrates the benefits of achieving our public health and environmental goals with legislation rather than relying solely on existing regulatory authority. Though we project a great deal of benefits will arise from implementation of the NOx SIP call, the journey has been difficult and is not yet over. The NOx SIP call was designed to reduce ozone-forming emissions by one million tons across the eastern United States. The rulemaking was based on consultations begun in 1995 among states, industry, EPA, and nongovernmental organizations. A Federal rule was finalized in 1998. As a result of litigation, one state was dropped and the 2003 compliance deadline was moved back for most states. Most states are required to comply in 2004, although two states will have until 2005 or later. Meanwhile, sources in these states continue to contribute to Eastern smog problems. Although the courts have largely upheld the NOx SIP Call, the litigation is not completely over. Industry and state challenges to the rules have made planning for pollution control installations difficult, raised costs to industry and consumers, and delayed health and environmental benefits. In contrast, reductions from the Acid Rain Program began soon after it passed (even before EPA finalized implementing regulations). There were few legal challenges to the small number of rules EPA had to issue--and none of the challenges delayed implementation of the program. The results of the program have been dramatic--and unprecedented. Compliance has been nearly 100 percent. Reductions in power plant SOINF2/INF emissions were larger and earlier than required, providing earlier human health and environmental benefits. Now, in the ninth year of the program, we know that the greatest SOINF2/INF emissions reductions were achieved in the highest SOINF2/INF-emitting states; acid deposition dramatically decreased over large areas of the eastern United States in the areas where they were most critically needed; trading did not cause geographic shifting of emissions or increases in localized pollution (hot spots); and the human health and environmental benefits were delivered broadly. The compliance flexibility and allowance trading has reduced compliance costs by 75 percent from initial EPA estimates. [See 2001 Acid Rain Program Progress Report submitted for the record.] It is clear from this example that existing regulatory tools often take considerable time to achieve significant results, and can be subject to additional years of litigation before significant emissions reductions are achieved. Under this scenario, there are few incentives to reduce emissions until rules are final and litigation is complete, posing potentially significant delays in achieving human health and environmental benefits. The Clean Air Act contains several provisions under which EPA will be required to impose further emission controls on power plants in order to allow states to meet the new national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for PMINF2.5/INF and ozone. For example, Section 126 of the Clean Air Act provides a petition process that states can use to force EPA to issue regulations to reduce emissions of SOINF2/INF and NOx from upwind sources, including power plants. A number of states have indicated that they intend to submit Section 126 petitions in the near future. However, compared to Clear Skies, this approach will almost certainly involve years of litigation and uncertainty about reduction targets and timetables. Additional reductions are required from power plants through the regional haze rule's BART (Best Available Retrofit Technology) requirements and forthcoming mercury MACT (maximum achievable control technology) requirements. EPA is required to propose by the end of 2003 a MACT standard for utility mercury emissions that must be met, plant- by-plant, by every coal-fired utility with unit capacity above 25 megawatts. EPA is required to finalize this rule by the end of 2004. The Act generally gives sources 3 years within which to comply with MACT standards. This compliance obligation could be delayed by a court if EPA's rule is challenged. Because these regulations will be the product of separate Federal, state and judicial processes, comparable health and environmental protection is likely to cost more under the current Clean Air Act than under Clear Skies. EPA estimates that a comprehensive, integrated approach relying on cap-and-trade programs could reduce costs by one fourth as compared to the regulatory approach achieving comparable emission reductions. These cost savings would be passed on to the public through lower electricity prices and greater profitability to investors and owners of electric generation.

New Source Review Some have suggested that Clear Skies is an attempt to undermine the Clean Air Act. This is simply not true. To achieve the next generation of environmental progress, we must build on the successful provisions in laws that have served us well--and learn from those provisions that have not served us well, or have had only limited success. New Source Review (NSR) is an example of a program that EPA and stakeholders have long recognized is not working well. There is a misconception that the principle goal of the NSR program is to reduce emissions from power plants. This is simply incorrect. Reducing emissions from power plants is the principle goal of Clear Skies. The NSR program is triggered only when facilities emitting large amounts of air pollution are built, and when modifications at these facilities result in significant increases in air pollution. The NSR program is not designed to result in nationwide reductions of air pollution from power plants. When it comes to reducing harmful air emissions from power plants, Clear Skies would accomplish more than NSR. Clear Skies would significantly modify the NSR program for power plants, but contain some important backstops. We expect that existing power plants would not have to go through NSR for modifications. New sources would no longer have to go through the entire NSR process, but some aspects of the process would still apply. Although we believe that with a tight cap on emissions, new sources will always install good controls, we did not want to run the risk that a new source would be uncontrolled. Therefore, as a backstop, Clear Skies would require all new power plants to meet New Source Performance Standards that are set in the statute. In addition, new power generators locating within 50 km of a Class I area (e.g., national parks or wilderness areas) would still be subject to the current NSR requirements for the protection of those areas. Finally, new power plants will also have to meet the current NSR requirements that they will not cause or contribute to a violation of the national ambient air quality standards.

IV. WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY

Because of the lessons learned over the last decade, there is increasing support for legislation such as Clear Skies that would significantly reduce and cap power plant emissions and create a market- based system to minimize control costs. From environmental groups to coal companies, there is increasing broad-based support demonstrating that multipollutant legislation is a preferable path to cleaner air. Such an approach would address an array of air pollution concerns associated with power generation--including fine particles, smog, mercury deposition, acid rain, nitrogen deposition, and visibility impairment--at lower cost and with more certainty than currently allowed by the Clean Air Act. The Acid Rain Program is widely accepted as one of the most effective air pollution programs ever adopted and has consequently attracted worldwide attention and emulation. The Program's track record has encouraged Congress to consider broader applications of cap-and- trade programs to address multiple air pollutants. The common elements of the proposals considered by Congress are mandatory caps on emissions of multiple pollutants from the power generation sector, implemented through allowance trading programs modeled after the Acid Rain Program. There is no better time for Congress to be considering multipollutant legislation. President Bush has indicated that Clear Skies is his top environmental priority. The number of proposals being considered by Congress also indicates a consensus behind the basic idea of a multipollutant cap-and-trade approach. The Large Public Power Council, Edison Electric Institute, Adirondack Council, and numerous individual utilities have all expressed support for the scope and framework of Clear Skies.If legislation passes quickly, we will begin achieving emissions reductions and related health benefits now. Congress needs to act now so that we do not lose a decade's worth of health and environmental benefits from reducing fine PM pollution, smog, acid deposition, nitrogen deposition, and regional haze. Further, as EPA continues to implement additional forthcoming regulations under the existing framework of the Act, the likelihood of our ability to pursue an integrated program diminishes--and with it diminish the numerous advantages that I have delineated today of an approach like Clear Skies. Legislation is also needed now to help states with their air quality planning and provide incentives for industry innovation, which, in turn, would lower costs and emissions. Such incentives are particularly compelling this year as we approach the task of reducing mercury emissions from the power industry. If designed correctly, legislation could provide the incentive that spurs technological innovation. When stringent yet flexible mechanisms exist, substantial technological improvements and steady reductions in control costs can be expected to follow. Congress obviously has much to consider as it weighs Clear Skies and other multipollutant proposals this year. We anticipate and welcome a rigorous and healthy debate on these issues.</text>

      <text>STATEMENT OF KATERI CALLAHAN

Ms. Callahan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Kateri Callahan, and I serve as the President of the Alliance to Save Energy. The Alliance to Save Energy is a nonprofit and bipartisan coalition of leaders from business, government, and industry, and Mr. Chairman, on behalf of our organization, we want to thank you for the leadership that you are providing as our new board member, and the leadership that we are getting from your colleague on the committee, Congressman Markey, in helping us to meet our mission, which is to promote energy efficiency worldwide for a cleaner environment, a more robust economy, and healthier energy security. Energy efficiency is our country's greatest indigenous resource. Over the past 30 years, our studies show that energy efficiency and conservation are now displacing the need for 40 quads of energy each year. This means that energy efficiency is actually contributing more than coal, more than nuclear, and even more than petroleum to meeting this country's thirst for energy. Yet, it remains a resource that can deliver even more, and it can do so more quickly and more cheaply and more cleanly than any other supply, if we give it appropriate and meaningful public policy support. And it is for this reason that the Alliance strongly supports the energy efficiency provisions that are in H.R. 6, but at the same time, we urge you, Mr. Chairman, and your colleagues, to expand and enhance these provisions, so that the full potential of energy efficiency can be unleashed to lower demand and to extend our energy supplies. The Federal programs and policies that were established by the Congress, like the appliance and motor vehicle standards, research and development, and the Energy Star program, have helped to make energy efficiency a key contributor to our Nation's economy. For example, every single Federal dollar that is invested in the Energy Star program is now returning $75 in consumer energy savings, and also, sparking $15 of private sector investment. Over the past year, our organization has been exploring public policies that would deploy energy efficiency into every end use sector of the economy, as well as electricity and natural gas, to have a significant impact on the projected growth in energy demand between now and 2010. We have examined nearly 100 different policies and programs, and we have chosen those that are the most critical, but also, the ones we believe are the most politically saleable. The Energy Information Administration is just now completing its analysis of these policies, and the findings suggest that taken together and if enacted, we might reduce the anticipated growth in energy demand between now and 2010 by up to 10 percent. The savings from our recommended package are even more impressive in the out years. By 2025, we estimate that the policies we are recommending could reduce the anticipated growth by 15 percent or more. Our policy recommendations are set out in detail in my written testimony, and they cover, I think this is very important, the energy efficiency provisions that are already in H.R. 6, but under our plan, those provisions would be enhanced and expanded. For example, and very importantly, the committee's discussion draft would place crippling limitations on a very effective program. It is something called the ESPC, or the Energy Savings Performance Contract program, which facilitates energy efficiency upgrades to Federal buildings. This program is helping taxpayers to save a billion dollars each year in reduced Federal energy costs. It is a program that should be expanded, not constrained, as it is in the committee's current draft. Our policy package also goes beyond the provisions in H.R. 6, and particularly, I would note that we would look to reform the current CAFE program, to assure that the fuel economy requirements that are in current law are being met by the automotive industry. We address the building sector through an innovative program that would assist States in putting in place the most aggressive and current energy efficiency standards, and finally, building code standards. And finally, the gains in energy efficiency come largely from new technologies and improvement to existing technologies. Therefore, continuing and enhancing Federal programs, and supporting research, development, and deployment of energy- efficient technologies and practices, is a key component of our package. Mr. Chairman, we believe we need to shed the cardigan sweater images of yesteryear, and get focused and serious about market-friendly ways to save energy. We need to no longer treat energy efficiency as the forgettable stepchild in the energy debate. Near-term and long-term energy efficiency has a proven track record as the most abundant, the least costly, and the most domestically secure way to address our energy needs. The Alliance believes we need to expand the use of this national resource through meaningful public policy, so that we can reap the full potential of its benefits. Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Kateri Callhan, President, Alliance to Save Energy

Introduction My name is Kateri Callahan and I serve as the President of the Alliance to Save Energy, a bipartisan, nonprofit coalition of more than 90 business, government, environmental and consumer leaders. The Alliance's mission is to promote energy efficiency worldwide to achieve a healthier economy, a cleaner environment, and greater energy security. The Alliance, founded in 1977 by Senators Charles Percy and Hubert Humphrey, currently enjoys the leadership of Senator Byron Dorgan as Chairman; Washington Gas Chairman and CEO James DeGraffenreidt, Jr. as Co-Chairman; and Representatives Ralph Hall, Zach Wamp and Ed Markey and Senators Bingaman, Collins and Jeffords as its Vice-Chairs. Attached are a list of the Alliance's Board of Directors and its Associate members, which I respectfully request be included in the record as part of this testimony.

Energy Efficiency: A Key Resource for a Sound National Energy Future The Alliance to Save Energy believes that policies and programs to advance energy efficiency must be a central focus of any sound comprehensive national energy legislation. Energy efficiency now contributes more than any single energy resource to meeting the country's energy needs, and is the quickest, cheapest, and cleanest way to meet the anticipated growth in energy demand in the U.S. The Alliance is developing a package of policy initiatives intended to assist the Nation in achieving significant energy savings through pursuit of widespread and aggressive energy efficiency programs. The proposed policy initiatives will be described in an upcoming Alliance report, ``Vision 2010: An Energy Efficiency Policy Prescription''. The Alliance will quantify, to the greatest extent possible, the energy savings impacts of the various suggested policies.

Why an energy efficiency vision? Both natural gas and oil prices have more than doubled in the last few years. In 1999, natural gas prices were $3.10 per thousand cubic feel (mcf); today they are averaging $6.40 per mcf. The latest numbers indicate that gasoline prices are approximately 17 percent higher than this time last year. High prices have caused plant closings, loss of manufacturing jobs, and a variety of other direct and negative impacts to the U.S. economy. In a recent survey, business leaders placed energy costs as their second greatest concern after rising healthcare costs.SUP1/SUP --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ The October 2004 survey was developed by Robert Half Management Resources and conducted by an independent research firm. The survey includes responses from 1,400 CFOs from a stratified random sample of U.S. companies with more than 20 employees. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Energy efficiency and conservation measures taken since 1973 now displace the need for 40 Quads of energy each year, exceeding the nation's consumption of petroleum. Federal policies and programs such as appliance and motor vehicle standards, research and development, and Energy Star made major contributions to these savings. Energy efficiency must play a central role in the nation's energy future. With only 2 percent of known world oil reserves within domestic borders, public opposition to increasing the generation of electricity from nuclear energy and coal, an electricity grid that is under significant and growing stress in many regions of the country, and only a modest though growing contribution from renewable energy resources, there is simply no choice. Even the National Petroleum Council has concluded that natural gas supplies from traditional North American production will not be able to meet projected demand, and that ``greater energy efficiency and conservation are vital near-term and long-term mechanisms for moderating price levels and reducing volatility.'' The potential to increase energy efficiency's contribution to meeting America's energy needs is significant. And for this reason, the Alliance to Save Energy strongly supports the energy efficiency provisions included in the conference report to H.R. 6, The Energy Policy Act of 2003 in recognition of the fact that these provisions will help our nation lessen its dependence on imported oil, protect the environment, and boost the economy. The Alliance does, however, believe that the energy efficiency provisions in H.R. 6 must be expanded and enhanced if we are to realize all of the potential gains that can accrue from widespread adoption of energy efficiency measures across many sectors of the economy. Last year, the Alliance to Save Energy, in consultation with experts from industry, universities, government, and other public interest groups, initiated an examination of a wide array of energy efficiency policies directed at all energy end use sectors as well as electricity and natural gas. A priority purpose of the initiative was to identify a set of policies that would significantly reduce growth in US energy consumption by all sectors if enacted into law. To guide our efforts, the Alliance established an achievable, but extremely aggressive energy growth reduction goal, and we also established a very short timeframe--five years--in which to achieve the reduction goal. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has projected that energy use in the year 2010 will rise to 112 quadrillion Btus (``Quads''). The goal established by the Alliance was to reduce the projected level by 7 Quads, which represents a 50% reduction in anticipated growth over the five year period. In culling policies to those most critical and saleable, the energy savings of the package now being formulated under Vision 2010 likely will not meet the aggressive goal, though the savings will be significant. We recognize that 2010 is a very short time frame for policies to take effect--we expect that the policy package would have a much more robust impact on energy use in subsequent years. To reach the target goal, we considered policies that could reduce energy use by approximately 5 percent in each end-use sector-- residential and commercial buildings, industry, and transportation--and to reduce energy losses by 5 percent in electricity and natural gas transmission. Of the policies considered, some of the most significant savings are projected to result from cross-cutting policies that affect multiple sectors simultaneously.

Comparison of Energy Efficiency Policies in H.R. 6 Conference Report and Vision 2010 As stated above, the Alliance to Save Energy strongly supports the energy efficiency provisions in the conference report to H.R. 6, but believes that more can be done to improve energy efficiency in each of the following sectors: buildings, transportation, the electric and natural gas utilities, and the industrial sector. Listed below is a discussion of the specific energy efficiency provisions included in the H.R. 6 conference report, and actions the Alliance to Save Energy believes the federal government should take to further the efficiency gains in these sectors.

I. RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS

Appliance and equipment standards National appliance and equipment standards are an important and effective policy tool. They provide an efficiency baseline that American consumers can trust, provide uniform national rules for manufacturers, and slash wasteful energy consumption with one broad and effective stroke. The federal appliance energy efficiency standards program began in 1987 and has been among the most effective of all efficiency measures. The program already has saved an estimated 2.5 percent of all U.S. electricity use representing billions of dollars of savings to America's consumers. The conference report to H.R. 6 includes a package of new energy efficiency standards that were negotiated between energy efficiency interest groups, including the Alliance to Save Energy, and the manufacturers of products proposed for regulation. These provisions would establish standards in law for exit signs, torchiere lamps, dry- type transformers, traffic signal modules, unit heaters, and compact florescent lamps. They also require DOE to establish standards through rulemakings for ceiling fans, commercial refrigerators and freezers, vending machines, unit-heaters and batteries. The Alliance to Save Energy believes these standards should be established, and broadened to include new agreements on commercial air conditioners, dehumidifiers, pre-rinse spray valves, ceiling fans, and commercial refrigerators and freezers. In addition, the Alliance to Save Energy believes the U.S. Department of Energy should be encouraged to accelerate rulemakings that are years behind schedule. For example, the standard for residential furnaces was due in 1994. The most recent delay, announced in December, means that DOE will not set these standards until late 2007 at the earliest, and that the standards will not go into effect until at least 2010--fully 16 years beyond the statutory deadline. According to a September 2004 report published by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, each year of delay in just three of these national standards--residential furnaces and boilers, distribution transformers, and commercial air conditioners and heat pumps--locks in $7.1 billion in higher energy costs for consumers and businesses. In recognition of the fact that establishing standards requires a rigorous, time consuming, and costly rulemaking process, the Alliance also believes increased funding to the DOE standards program is critical to ensuring that the backlog in standards' rulemakings is placed on a fast track.

Energy Star The Energy Star program represents one of the government's most successful efforts to date in advancing energy efficiency through market transformation. The Energy Star program is an entirely voluntary program that is yielding significant economic returns to our nation's consumers and significant environmental benefits to our nation as a whole. Studies estimate that every federal dollar spent on the Energy Star program results in an average savings of $75 or more in consumer energy bills; the reduction of about 3.7 tons of carbon dioxide emissions; and an investment of $15 in private sector capital in development of energy-efficient technologies and products. The H.R. 6 conference report authorizes a voluntary Energy Star program at EPA and DOE and directs the Administrator and Energy Secretary to solicit comments of interested parties in establishing or revising an Energy Star product category; the provision requires a 9- month lead time before the implementation of any changes to the program. The Alliance to Save Energy believes the eligibility requirements for becoming an Energy Star product should be updated to ensure that the market is encouraged toward the most efficient buildings and products. And, drawing on the success of the program, the Alliance believes that it should be expanded to cover more products and services. While not the jurisdiction of this Committee, the Alliance also believes that consumer tax incentives should be provided for products that go well beyond Energy Star levels and that funding for Energy Star is increased.

Building Codes In a typical year, the United States builds about 1.7 million new housing units including single-family, multi-family and manufactured dwelling units. Building energy codes are a means by which states and municipalities can assure that minimum levels of energy efficiency are achieved in these new buildings. The H.R. 6 conference report does not address the issue of building codes. The Alliance to Save Energy encourages the creation of a $25 million federal fund to support states in assuring adoption and compliance with the most current and aggressive building energy codes. Manufactured housing (``mobile homes'') represents one out of 7.5 new single-family housing starts and is not subject to local building codes. Manufacturers argue that they cross state lines and shouldn't be controlled by state and local building codes; thus they are instead regulated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Current HUD standards have been in place since 1996 and have not been updated since then. New proposed standards negotiated with industry through the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA-501), providing modest improvements, may be adopted by HUD in the next year or two. However, recent DOE research shows that it is cost effective to build manufactured housing to current IECC model energy code specifications, adapted to the three HUD climate zones. The Alliance to Save Energy recommends that manufactured housing be required to meet the current IECC model energy code, particularly as the market segment for this product tends to be modest-to-low income consumers who can ill-afford high energy bills. The Alliance encourages Congress to update the HUD manufactured housing standards to current IECC levels. These updates would reduce energy bills of mobile home owners by 9% and reduce overall energy use in mobile homes by 3 trillion btus in 2010, increasing to 8 trillion btus by 2025.

Federal Energy Management Program America's largest, single energy consumer is the federal government. According to the 1998 Alliance to Save Energy report, Leading by Example: Improving Energy Productivity in Federal Government Facilities, the federal government wastes $1 billion in taxpayer dollars each year on its buildings that use energy inefficiently. Few federal programs have been as cost-effective as the U.S. Department of Energy's Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP). At an average cost of $20 million per year, FEMP has helped cut federal building energy waste by nearly 21 percent from 1985-1999--a reduction that now saves federal taxpayers roughly $1 billion each year in reduced energy costs. However, much more can be done, and the Alliance supports the Federal Energy Management provisions of the H.R. 6 conference report to require further energy saving by the federal government. A vital tool for upgrading the efficiency of the federal government is the use of Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs). This unique program allows federal agencies to contract with the private sector to upgrade the efficiency of federal buildings and pay-off the contract with the utility savings. The agency saves energy at no additional cost, the companies build their business and create jobs, and the government saves money and pollution. Unfortunately, this program sunset in 2003, and it must be permanently reauthorized immediately. The Alliance to Save Energy is pleased that Congress provided an extension of the Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) program until October 1, 2006 as part of the Defense Authorization bill (Public Law 108-375). And we support the permanent extension located in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. However, we are very concerned about the limitations placed on this program in the legislation. Capping this program at 60 projects and $300 million for DOD, VA, and DOE only will further harm the program that is just re-emerging from a costly delay in reauthorization. Due to this lapse in authority, nearly $500 million worth of energy savings projects were stalled--harming business around the country and wasting taxpayer dollars. This is a program that should be authorized permanently to assure stability in the industry and to give federal agencies the ability to continue to upgrade facilities to the benefit of taxpayers, our nation's environment and energy security. Once reauthorized, the Alliance believes that the program should be expanded to allow for efficiency upgrades in the federal government's mobile assets--from planes, to tanks, to passenger vehicles. For example, expansion of the program could afford the military the ability to retrofit the B-52 Bomber (which currently relies on a 1960's-era engine) or the Abrams tank (which has a 1970's-era engine). In fact, a 2002 Defense Science Board report listed over 16 weapons systems that are candidates for such upgrades, covering every service and virtually every major defense contractor. While this expansion would save oil and advance national security goals, the first step is permanently reauthorizing the ESPC program.

Tax Incentives Providing incentives to consumers and businesses is an important policy option that can help transform markets to embrace energy- efficient technologies and practices. The Alliance to Save Energy believes tax incentives are an important piece of any balanced energy plan, and we support the energy efficiency tax incentives that are part of the conference report to H.R. 6. This package of efficiency tax incentives represents a bipartisan compromise that would benefit businesses and consumers across the country, and we recommend passage of these important incentives as quickly as possible. Tax incentives for highly efficient new homes will show home builders across the nation that incorporating energy-efficient technologies into homes is neither as difficult nor as expensive as they now contend. Tax credits for highly efficient refrigerators and clothes washers will encourage the manufacture and purchase of energy and water-saving appliances. The tax deduction for commercial buildings will give business owners the incentive to outfit their commercial space with energy-efficient equipment. In addition, tax credits to upgrade the efficiency of existing homes will help everyday Americans cope with volatile natural gas and heating oil prices. These incentives, in addition to the incentives for highly efficient fuel cells, combined heat and power systems, and advanced electricity metering, can play an important role in helping this nation transition to energy efficient appliances and technologies.

II. ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS UTILITIES

Over the last two decades, states worked with regulated utilities using ``Integrated Resource Planning'' and demand-side management programs to avoid the need for about 100 300-Megawatt (MW) power plants. However, utility spending on public benefit programs nationwide was cut in half as states and the electricity industry prepared for expected deregulation. Two national policy strategies that could increase energy efficiency in the utility sector are: (1) a federal public benefits funds (PBFs); and, (2) a federal Energy Efficiency Performance Standards (EEPS). Neither of these two energy efficiency measures is included in the conference report to H.R. 6.

Energy Efficiency Performance Standards Energy efficiency performance standards (EEPS) require retail electricity suppliers to meet customer needs in part through energy efficiency and load reduction programs rather than by constructing new generation and transmission facilities. EEPS can be instituted in conjunction with, or independent of, a national Public Benefits Fund (PBF). While several states are considering creating EEPS, only two states--Texas and Pennsylvania--have instituted them in some form. If one were to follow the model signed by then-Governor Bush in Texas, electric and natural gas suppliers would be required to take measures to help their customers reduce consumption by a set amount each year. Utilities also could meet the requirement, in part, by reducing supply- side losses, could trade credits with other utilities, or could buy credits (the funds would be added to a public benefits fund). Savings due to lower energy use and lower prices should more than pay for the cost of the measures. For example, according to estimates by ACEEE, by 2020 a 1 percent federal EEPS would:

Save over 340 billion kWh a year; Save consumers over $12 billion a year; and, Reduce peak electricity demand by about 68,000 MW (avoiding about 225 power plants). Through Vision 2010, the Alliance has begun a dialogue between utilities that would be subject to any national policies on PBF or EEPs, government, academia and other stakeholders. Our goal is to develop, and present to the Congress in the coming weeks, recommendations for a workable, cost-effective program that recognizes and addresses the differences in the political and business circumstances of states.

Public Benefits Fund Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have created a guaranteed stream of funds for energy efficiency and other public goods via public benefit funds (PBFs). The funds are built typically from a small surcharge on electricity and natural gas bills. The programs may be administered by utilities, states, or independent organizations. Of the states that have passed restructuring laws and rules, all but two (Oklahoma, and Virginia) also have passed some form of PBF; in addition, three states (Minnesota, Vermont, and Wisconsin) have created PBFs without restructuring. Creation of a federal PBF that would provide matching funds to any state in which a PBF exists and/or would be accessible to any state with an EEPS in place could serve to encourage states to deploy such innovative techniques to advancing energy efficiency. A federal PBF could help stabilize electricity prices through reduced demand, reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and ease the need for massive infrastructure replacement. By 2020, ACEEE estimates that a federal PBF would:

Save 1.3 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) a year; Reduce peak electricity demand by 160,000 MW (equivalent to about 500 power plants); Save consumers $68 billion (net after investments); and, Prevent greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 96 million metric tons of carbon each year. Transformers Tax Incentive The energy bill conference report would provide accelerated, three- year depreciation for time-of-use meters. Time-of-use meters allow customers to shift their electricity use away from peak periods of the day when power is most expensive, which also can increase the efficiency of the power plant. In addition, the Alliance to Save Energy believes it is important to support accelerated depreciation for distribution transformers and new generation units that significantly exceed the efficiency of new transformer standards.

Voluntary Agreements While the conference report to H.R. 6 authorizes DOE to enter into voluntary agreements with industrial companies for significant reductions in energy intensity, and to publicize the corresponding achievements, the conference report does not include a similar provision for the electric and natural gas utilities. The Alliance to Save Energy would encourage DOE and EPA to seek agreements from the entire industry to reduce fossil fuel heat rates and natural gas losses.

III. TRANSPORTATION

Today, more than two-thirds of the oil consumed in the United States is used for transportation. This sector accounts for the majority of CO and NOINFX/INF emissions in the U.S., and it is responsible for approximately 33% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. These realities, coupled with the fact that U.S. vehicle miles traveled are growing at a faster rate than vehicles and at more than twice the rate of the population, underscore the criticality of improving the efficiency of today's passenger cars and trucks immediately. While the automotive industry has begun to introduce energy efficient transportation options, like hybrid electric vehicles, much, much more needs to be done to ensure that larger numbers of hybrids are introduced into the marketplace, and that consumers make the choice to purchase these and other energy efficient transportation technologies. Hybrids represent an immediate and more fuel efficient option for consumers of today and tomorrow, and they also can serve as a bridge to fuel cell electric vehicles of tomorrow that hold the promise of clean, sustainable mobility. Unfortunately, there are only five hybrid electric vehicle offerings to choose from in the marketplace and, while they are receiving growing attention by the media and the public, hybrids still represent less than one percent of the 17 million vehicles sold in the United States each year. Furthermore, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards have remained static for almost two decades due to political gridlock. The current standard of 27.5 miles per gallon for automobiles first applied in 1985, and the 21 mpg standard for light trucks is only 0.5 mpg above the 1987 standard (but is now set to rise to 22.2 mpg by 2007). In fact, lack of federal action, coupled with the dramatic expansion in sales of SUVs, has led to a significant drop in overall fuel economy. America's average gas mileage peaked in 1987-1988, declined for more than ten years, and is now flat. Furthermore, and alarmingly, EIA estimates that on-road fuel economy is about 20% lower than test results used for CAFE standards. This means that consumers are receiving inaccurate information about what they might expect to realize in terms of the vehicle they purchase, and more importantly, the standards that have been set nationally--and not updated for 20 years--are not being met.

Close CAFE Loophole Efforts in Congress to increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for passenger vehicles have been unsuccessful since the mid-1980's. And, it appears unlikely that the 109th Congress will be the one to increase these standards. Notwithstanding this assumption, it is imperative to continue--and increase--efforts to improve the fuel economy of the vehicle fleet by reforming the current CAFE regulations through legislative and/or federal rulemakings. The fuel economy tests should be revised to better reflect real-world driving and to bring the estimates of fuel economy in line with EIA and other authoritative sources. Second, passenger cars should be redefined to include SUVs and minivans, which are used for the same purposes, i.e. transporting people. Today, about half of all light-duty vehicles sold in America are light trucks, and most of these are SUVs and minivans. Including SUVs and minivans as passenger vehicles could increase fuel economy by 1 mpg, and save 5 billion gallons a year. Third, the CAFE credit for ``dual-fuel'' vehicles, which can run on ethanol or on gasoline, should be ended or revised to require actual use of the alternative fuel. Today, dual fuel vehicles are being fueled almost exclusively--99% of the time--with gasoline. With only 188 ethanol fueling stations in 27 states, the infrastructure does not exist to supply these vehicles with alternative fuel. This credit has encouraged manufacturers to put millions of dual fuel vehicles on the road, but is also has allowed them to put more gas guzzlers on the road, and thus increase gasoline use. The credit should be terminated or modified to require actual use of the alternative fuel. Finally, vehicles up to 10,000 pounds should be included in CAFE. CAFE standards only apply to vehicles up to 8,500 pounds (gross vehicle weight). In fact, EPA does not even test or report the fuel economy of larger vehicles, but their mileage is generally much lower. Manufacturers are selling more and more of these super-large SUVs and pickup trucks, such as GM Hummers and Ford Excursions. The weight limit should be raised to include these heavier vehicles.

Vehicle Fuel Use Feebate The Alliance to Save Energy encourages the Congress to consider a new, innovative approach to efficiency of light-duty cars and trucks by promoting a national ``feebate'' system. Such a system could impose a national security surcharge, or ``fee'' on inefficient vehicles, and then use the funds collected to provide a ``rebate'' to the most fuel efficient vehicles. The fee or rebate on new vehicles could be based upon the expected lifetime fuel use of the vehicle. Rates could be set to be revenue neutral, but the public would know that when it makes a vehicle purchasing decision, a higher price premium will be realized for the less efficient vehicle options. Such a system would reward consumers who make the choice to purchase fuel efficient vehicles; individuals who purchase gas guzzlers will pay a premium for making this purchasing decision.

Tax Incentives Hybrid electric vehicles still carry a price premium ranging from $3,000-$4,000 per vehicle. (Further, new models coming into the market could carry an even steeper price premium.) In order to assist consumers in making the choice to purchase these energy efficient transportation options, which represent less than 1 percent of the 17 million vehicles sold per year, the Alliance to Save Energy encourages the Congress to support consumer-based tax incentives for these energy efficient technologies. Such an incentive would ``level the playing field'' in the market place for hybrids, and allow consumers to make the choice to purchase a vehicle that will save them money over its lifetime without having to factor in purchase price differentials. The conference report to H.R. 6 provides a tax credit ranging from $250- $3400 for hybrid and lean burn diesel vehicles based on fuel economy and gas savings, and a larger credit for heavy-duty vehicles, capped for each manufacturer. The Alliance supports this approach and hopes that the Congress will devise a meaningful package of tax incentives that will support the building of a long-term and sustainable market for hybrid electric and other fuel-efficient vehicles. In addition, Congress also should eliminate the business deduction for SUVs (which was reduced to $25,000 last year). A federal incentive for fuel-inefficient vehicles is counter-intuitive to our Nation's energy security and environmental goals, and also negates current positive purchase signals in the marketplace, including the so-called ``gas guzzler's tax'' and the tax deduction for hybrid and other alternative fuel vehicles.

Fleet Requirements The conference report to H.R. 6 includes a variety of flexibility options to assist fleets in complying with the Alternative Fuel Vehicle (AFV) acquisition requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-486 aka ``EPAct''). In recognition of the fact that some fleets have had a difficult time meeting these requirements, and/or they would like to comply with technologies that currently are not an eligible compliance option (e.g., hybrid electric vehicles), the Alliance to Save Energy strongly supports the provisions that would allow hybrid electric vehicles and other energy efficient transportation technologies to be an eligible compliance option.

Industry Industry accounts for one-third of all energy use in the U.S. Energy-intensive industrial plants typically have enormous energy bills, sometimes running into the millions of dollars annually. Energy efficiency improvements offer the potential for a significant return on investment for the industrial energy consumer in the form of lower utility bills. The energy bill conference report (H.R. 6) provided a 10% investment tax credit for combined heat and power systems up to 15 MW. The Alliance to Save Energy supports this tax credit, but would seek to include projects up to 50 MW. The conference report also authorized DOE to enter into voluntary agreements with industrial companies for significant reductions in energy intensity. The Alliance supports this concept, but would broaden the program to include EPA involvement, and further, would define the program such that the voluntary agreements would seek to reduce energy intensity 2.5 percent each year from 2007-2016. Furthermore, the program should require independent verification of all reductions below ``business-as-usual'', as well as a report to Congress on assistance needed to help achieve the reductions. Finally, the Alliance to Save Energy believes that medium and large businesses that emit at least 100,000 tons of CO2 in a year should be required to begin reporting these emissions to the government. This would allow the U.S. to establish a baseline for the sector, and to benchmark progress toward reducing CO2.

V. CROSS-CUTTING POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

Funding Energy Efficiency Funding for energy efficiency R&amp;D and deployment programs of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency should be doubled from levels provided in 2004 in recognition of not only the enormous potential that energy efficiency offers in helping to meet the anticipated growth in energy use, but also the demonstrated return on investment that such funding has yielded the government and consumers alike. The President's overall fiscal year 2006 budget request for DOE efficiency programs is $847 million, down $21 million from the FY 2005 appropriation, and $29 million from the Administration's FY 2005 request. This continues a gradual downward trend from $913 million appropriated in FY 2002. In addition to the overall decline, there were some major changes in priorities. The President has requested significant increases for fuel cell vehicles and for biorefineries. The money for these increases was taken from other energy efficiency programs--thus there are major cuts in core research, development and deployment programs in industrial energy efficiency, buildings efficiency, and other areas. Particularly distressing is a 19% cut to the appliance standards program despite worsening delays in meeting statutory deadlines, and a 21% cut in work to improve state building energy codes

CONCLUSION

American consumers need a balanced energy policy that takes aggressive steps to save energy wherever, and whenever, it is cost- effective and feasible. Energy efficiency is our largest energy resource, and it should be our first energy priority. The policy options identified by the Alliance, such as standards, tax credits, and federal energy management, have been proven effective on the national level. Others, such as energy efficiency performance standards and public benefits funds, have been tested in the states and we believe are ready for replication at the national level. And finally, gains in energy efficiency come largely from new technologies and improvement to existing technologies; therefore, continuing and enhancing federal programs that support research, development and deployment of energy efficient technologies and practices is imperative. The Alliance to Save Energy applauds the fact that this Committee is taking the first steps necessary to enacting meaningful and comprehensive energy legislation in the 109th Congress. With respect to energy efficiency provisions, which must be a cornerstone of any such energy legislation, we hope that last year's energy bill conference report, H.R. 6, represents only the starting point, and that the energy efficiency provisions will be expanded and enhanced to assure that we give the American people immediate, cost-effective and sustainable assistance in addressing spiraling energy costs and an ever-less secure energy future.</text>

      <text>STATEMENT OF DAVID HAMILTON

Mr. Hamilton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for having the Sierra Club to come and give our view on the bill. I wish I was going to give a more upbeat and sanguine assessment of it. And I also appreciate the committee's encouragement for us to give a very broad comment on the bill, as opposed to staying within the motor-fuels rubric. The Sierra Club believes that the U.S. can have an energy policy that provides the energy that we need to grow economically and fulfill our needs, that creates job, that controls energy costs for consumers, and that respects and preserves the environment. Unfortunately, H.R. 6 does not provide the policy that we need to get there, partly because of the way it was constructed and its evolution out of the National Energy Policy Development Group headed by the Vice President. H.R. 6, we believe, is weighted far too heavily toward an answer to every energy problem that is more ``supply solves the problem,'' and we believe that that ignores and neglects several of our key energy problems that we have yet to really make progress on, and those include oil dependency. The Energy Information Administration has looked at H.R. 6 and said this is not materially going to change price and supply. Okay. That is clearly one of our largest energy problems. H.R. 6 does not address global warming, and I think it is worth noting that today, in other areas of the world, the Kyoto protocol goes into effect, where other nations are rolling up their sleeves to acknowledge and figure out how they are going to address carbon emissions and the problem of global warming. Then 2004 saw an immense amount of research come out detailing what is happening from the global warming, and though the Sierra Club, as well as many of you, may have problems with the Kyoto treaty, the complete disengagement of the U.S. from international discussion on it is, we believe, a disgrace. Third, H.R. 6 will not protect consumers in the long run from price and supply swings, partly because we have such small oil reserves, related to our oil consumption. Increasing supply cannot fundamentally do the job of securing consumers. Fourth, H.R. 6 causes other environmental damage by drilling in environmentally sensitive areas. And Mr. Chairman, I was excited to see on my e-mail this morning that drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is planning to have been taken out of the energy bill. I would be even more excited to see it not offered as a stand-alone bill, but don't expect that. Mr. Hall. Don't get your hopes up. Mr. Hamilton. No, no danger. And the fifth thing that H.R. 6 exacerbates, rather than solves, is the fact that energy prices in this country are hugely distorted by a system of subsidies, by the fact that things like environmental costs, like global warming, are not included in energy prices, vastly distort the relative values of energy supply options. And until we go back and take another look at what tax breaks, what subsidies, what externalities really cost the American public, whether it is rising childhood asthma rates, whether it is lower tree growth in the Northeast because of acid rain, until we start including those kind of costs in our energy prices, we will always have a distorted market. Finally, we believe that there are 3 things that we should pursue much more heavily in an energy policy and a bipartisan strategy, we hope, can go a long way toward accomplishing this. We were very pleased to see that the National Commission on Energy Policy advocated the increase of auto-fuel efficiency standards to reduce our dependence on oil and to increase our national security. It will vastly reduce carbon emission; it will address global warming. Second, Mr. Chairman, I was very happy to see that you have see that you have become a vice-chair of the Alliance to Save Energy, where I worked for about 8\1/2\ years. We need to be much more aggressive about the energy efficiency programs that we take on, and I was very happy to hear Mr. Downes talking about the gas industry's interest in that. And you know, I talk about 3 studies in my testimony that I won't go into details of, but we can save money, create jobs, reduce emissions all in the same vote, by treating energy efficiency as an energy source in the same way if you pulled it out of the ground and burned it. And I think that we find, when we consider all of those costs, the environmental costs, that it is one our most economical, if not our most economical, energy source. Finally, the Senate has sent over, twice, a renewable energy portfolio standard that would give a boost to our renewable energy industries in the same way the U.S. Congress gave a boost to the nuclear industry in the late 1950's. We urge you to accept that at this time, when and if it comes over. You know, again, renewables are undervalued because of externalities and because of the vastly greater subsidies for conventional industries substantially distort the price. So we urge that you would accept the renewable portfolio standard. Again, Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for allowing me to come testify. [The prepared statement of David Hamilton follows:]

Prepared Statement of David Hamilton, Director, Global Warming and Energy Programs, Sierra Club

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for inviting the Sierra Club to testify on national energy legislation. My name is David Hamilton, and I am the Director of Global Warming and Energy Programs at the Sierra Club. The Sierra Club is a non-profit, non-partisan organization with about 750,000 members and chapters in 50 states and Puerto Rico.

INTRODUCTION

I am here today to comment on behalf of the Sierra Club on the upcoming Committee energy bill. I am very hesitant to address a bill I have not yet seen. But at the instruction of Committee staff, I am treating the Energy Policy Act OF 2005 as if it will have identical provisions to the H.R. 6 Conference Report from the 108th Congress. Though I am testifying today on the Oil, Natural Gas, and Motor Fuels panel, we appreciate the Committee's open invitation to make a broader comment on the bill. In as much as the Chairman and the Committee have chosen to make H.R. 6 and its successor a package rather than considering various provisions separately, it behooves us to look at the bill as a whole as the Congress again begins the process of considering the appropriate answers for our national energy problems. Mr. Chairman, the Sierra Club believes that our nation can have an energy policy that provides the needed resources for economic development, creates jobs for American workers, reduces energy costs and makes them more predictable for consumers, and respects and preserves our environment. We believe that, while such a policy requires that Americans be better educated about their energy choices, our nation brims with the ingenuity, creativity and drive required to solve our energy problems in a way that is, to use an overused word, sustainable. That means that we can prosper today while leaving our children and grandchildren equivalent assets and quality of life that they might prosper themselves in their maturity. The Sierra Club believes that H.R. 6 did not provide the kind of energy policy I just described. We strongly opposed H.R. 6 and it is likely we will strongly oppose the Energy Policy Act of 2005. We believe that the bill fails to measure up to an energy policy worthy of the nation in myriad ways. To say that it subverts existing environmental protections is to grossly understate the case. It leaves consumers with less protection from violent swings and steady upward pressure on energy prices. H.R. 6 gives vast subsidies to fully established industries and purports to support new, cleaner energy industries with one hand while it undercuts them with the other.

IT WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM--

But perhaps the greatest flaw of H.R. 6 is that it doesn't even address, much less solve many of our most thorny and pressing energy problems. The flaws in this energy bill can be traced to its origins and evolution from the 2001 report of the National Energy Policy Development Group, administered by the Vice President. Our issues with the secretive process of the Cheney Energy Task Force are on record with the Supreme Court and in the media. Our criticism of its results, however, stem from the assumption that a single-minded focus on increasing conventional energy supply is capable of solving the energy- related problems faced by our nation. As reflected by the Task Force report, that panel responded to natural gas and gasoline price hikes of 2001, and operated from the conclusion that we don't have enough energy and that our problems could largely be solved by simply augmenting our supplies of coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear electricity. They looked at our existing energy sectors and asked what can we do for the coal industry to make more coal-fired electricity. It asked what we can do for oil and natural gas to get more energy. How do we get nuclear power going again? The fundamental flaw of this approach is that both the NEPDG and H.R. 6 fail to address critical problems inherent in our energy system. Ironically, they are many of the same problems that motivate voters to create the political momentum to pass a bill, such as high gasoline prices. These problems will not be solved simply by an increase in energy supply. The Sierra Club believes that our most pressing energy problems are: 1.) Our Dangerous Dependence on Petroleum--H.R. 6 fails to protect American families from steadily increasing upward pressure on crude oil and gasoline prices. We continue to be reliant on politically unstable regions for the underpinning of our transportation system, and, by the judgment of the Energy Information Administration (EIA), H.R. 6 will not fundamentally affect the price and supply of oil. This remains true despite the scores of times that high gasoline prices have been used as a reason we need to pass this bill. It remains true despite the blitzkrieg of drilling for oil and gas that the bill unleashes on the wild areas of the United States. We use 25 percent of the world's oil supply and hold less than 3 percent of the world's reserves. We can open every square foot of our nation to fossil fuel exploration, and it will not begin to solve our problem. Our oil dependence saps our resources as prices rise, skimming the cream off of our economy and causing unpredictable cost swings for consumers. Crude oil prices have risen from the mid $20s per barrel to the mid $40s since 2000. Our failure to address our dependence on oil has cost literally trillions of dollars, according to Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Again, H.R. does nothing to materially solve the problem. Perhaps more importantly, H.R. 6 fails to protect American soldiers from the need to secure adequate future oil supplies. Without steps to actually save oil and stem the rising percentage of oil supply that is imported, the only alternative is to follow the NEPDG report's strategy of cajoling and using diplomatic leverage in oil-producing regions around the world and somehow motivate a near doubling of oil production over the next two decades. If that doesn't work, Mr. Chairman, what is our option? In our view, Mr. Chairman, solving our oil dependence problem is a matter of life and death. But this bill does not do it. 2.) Global Warming--It should not escape our notice, Mr. Chairman, that the Kyoto Protocol goes into effect today. The willful refusal of the United States to respond to the accumulated scientific evidence of global warming when we are responsible for far and away the greatest share of greenhouse gas emissions of any nation in the world constitutes an ongoing and growing national disgrace. Last year's multi-nation study of the effects of warming on the Arctic region shows that the environmental effects of global warming are advancing more quickly than scientists previously believed. There has been widespread melting of glaciers and sea ice as well as significant shortening of the snow season that carries dire implications for local populations and wildlife species. 2004 research on ocean chemistry revealed much about carbon absorption in our oceans and points up the vulnerability of their chemical and acidic balance. The geographic ranges of many plant and animal species are changing. Several noted climate scientists are warning of a potential ``tipping point'' at which the effects of warming accelerate and perhaps result in dramatic and permanent changes in our natural systems. It is with growing incredulity that the rest of the industrialized world views the effectiveness of energy industry disinformation campaigns with the American public. It is with growing distress that many Americans view the unresponsiveness of our political leaders to the significant and ominous results of the scientific inquiry thus far. Our lack of action to address global warming raises concern about the capacity of the U.S. Congress to respond to a genuine environmental emergency in the public interest. Further, even measures in H.R. 6 described as the key to a ``cleaner'' future are expected to be ineffective. The incentives in the bill for ``clean coal'' technology--though the Sierra Club has significant concerns over whether coal can be truly clean--have been argued to be a hedge against global warming. But EIA estimates that between now and 2025, 77 gigawatts of new coal capacity will be built in the U.S. Their estimate is that only 7-8 gigawatts, or roughly 10 percent of that total will be advanced clean coal technology. The lion's share of the new coal capacity is expected to be dirty, pulverized coal that could cripple prospective efforts to curb domestic global warming emissions and eviscerate demand for cleaner alternatives. There are currently 60 gigawatts of new coal capacity--or roughly 100 new plants--in the application pipeline across the country. Less than 10 percent of the new proposed capacity is IGCC, or another form of gasification. There is currently little attention being paid to the fact that possibly irrevocable national global warming policy is being made in hundreds of individual decisions around the country. These decisions by state agencies, public utility commissions, and the courts may well determine our ability to do anything about global warming in the future. They will certainly affect future demand for cleaner alternatives such as renewable energy and energy efficiency. As far as I know, no Committee in Congress or agency of the federal government has officially regarded this development as a matter of concern. We urge the Committee to address the implications of this new ``coal rush'' as soon as possible. 3.) Fluctuating and Increasing Energy Prices--American energy consumers remain at the mercy of not only periodic violent swings in consumer energy prices, but a steady upward pressure on oil and natural gas prices that has proven financially difficult, if not devastating for many American families. The remedies for our energy woes prescribed by H.R. 6 assume that solving the problems of the energy industries will solve problems for consumers. In fact, energy efficiency and demand reduction programs for oil, natural gas, and electricity have proven extremely fruitful solutions for price stability by reducing the likelihood of price spikes, and fostering broad-based economic returns and development. Unfortunately, demand reduction and efficiency programs received wholly insufficient attention in H.R. 6. 4.) Other Critical Environmental Damage--Beyond global warming, H.R. 6 fails to assign environmental quality the value it deserves in our society. There is a long list of environmental harms in this bill. Provisions will likely result in increased mercury contamination of waterways, the opening of some of our most environmentally sensitive and valuable lands to oil and gas drilling, increases in childhood asthma, water pollution, and wholesale landscape destruction caused by mountaintop removal and other forms of coal mining. The strategy behind H.R. 6 simply fails to solve our energy problems in a way that attempts to minimize environmental damage. We expect that when combined with provisions from the Resources Committee, the bill will again include the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas production. This is another example of how a myopic strategy of ``more energy'' fails to take into account the value of pristine wilderness or calculate the benefits to Americans of wild areas that will remain protected. Opening the Arctic Refuge to drill for oil that will supply us for only a few months--that won't begin to flow until 10 years after approval--will neither solve our oil dependence problems nor even noticeably delay them. We need better solutions that structurally change the equation. 5.) Distorted Energy Values--It is the year 2005, and we still fail to incorporate the societal costs of our energy system into the wholesale and retail prices of energy end products. We willfully ignore the costs of energy use to public health, the environment, diplomatic and military defense of our oil and gas supplies, and a system of accumulated subsidies that serves the haves at the expense of the have- nots and, while it continues to supply energy to American families, it does so on highly unfavorable terms. The Sierra Club urges the Congress to take a very close look at the complex web of U.S. energy subsidies with the intention of revealing the true relative costs of energy sources. The idea that U.S. energy consumers are somehow protected from extra energy costs by federal subsidies only obscures the true market value of energy. The distortion in true economic value that results from this system penalizes Americans and makes the job of choosing the most beneficial energy investments even more difficult. Though the federal government has agreed to take control of utilities' nuclear waste, taxpayers will still be paying the cost of its maintenance for 150,000 years, as well as the industry's liability insurance through the Price-Anderson Act. The cost of the Iraq war should be added to our price at the gas pump in order that we understand the relatively low cost of fuel efficiency. The public pays the health costs of high mercury concentrations in fish, exploding rates of childhood asthma, and depleted crop and lumber yields from acid rain--all ancillary costs of our energy use. That is not to mention the existing labyrinth of tax breaks for the oil, coal, gas, and nuclear industries. Even the relatively small subsidies for energy efficiency and renewable energy should be put on the table, as we believe a transparent and equitable system--the theoretical ``level playing field''--will result in a much bigger gain than loss for cleaner energy sources and a better system for the nation. A party that champions the free market should relish the opportunity to clear the air in this fashion.

BROADEN THE CRITERIA

H.R. 6 might have better addressed our range of energy problems if some additional criteria had been set to evaluate potential energy policies beyond more-energy-is-better. An energy policy based on industry wish-lists is good for energy companies, but we need an energy policy that is good for Americans--not just for the next quarter or next year, but through the lives of our children and grandchildren. If many of the criteria below were used to evaluate provisions considered for H.R. 6, I believe we would have ended up with an energy bill that looks largely different. We recommend the following criteria:

Prioritize policies that actually reduce price and supply volatility above and beyond simply providing marginal increases in output; Favor policies that reduce future greenhouse gas emissions, criteria air pollution, or water pollution and their inevitable future costs; Seek measures that maximize the overall benefit to the taxpayer and American families, factoring in environmental externalities and equalizing for the level of public subsidy currently provided for that industry; Favor strategies that will create broad-based economic development and job creation rather than profit for narrow existing industries; Energy policies should enhance genuine free market competition within an industry and prevent concentrations of market power that can potentially harm American families and create the atmosphere of abuse that led to the Enron scandal and its self-dealing and price fixing; Set a very high bar for requests by industries to eliminate environmental measures as regulatory barriers to increased production, requiring that there be significant evidence that the environmental regulation has actually depressed production--not just increased costs or proved a nuisance to producers--and require evidence that the benefit would significantly outstrip the existing benefit to public health and the environment of the regulation; Consider the conveyance of drilling rights on environmentally sensitive and protected lands something that should occur as a lat resort--after cheaper, cleaner options like energy efficiency are fully exploited. We hold that had a least-cost priority structure for energy policy options been used to build our energy policy--H.R. 6 would have been much more focused on demand reduction strategies and fostering renewable energy than it is now. By participating in a process that sought to fill industry wish-lists, and then allowed those measures with the most political muscle behind them to survive, Congress has done the nation a disservice and put its future economic, environmental, and military security at the mercy of highly volatile markets without solving the problems inherent in our reliance on those markets. One of the many benefits of energy efficiency programs is the level to which they insure energy markets against price and supply shocks--or even rescue them as in the case of the California electricity crisis of 2001. Failure to even attempt the most rudimentary assistance to states or incentives for creating and sustaining strong energy efficiency programs is a glaring indicator that the power of these options is either being misunderstood or ignored by the U.S. Congress.

WHAT H.R. 6 IS MISSING

We believe that H.R. 6 vastly under-utilizes both energy efficiency and renewable energy options. Due to the skewed costs of energy caused by the tangled web of subsidies and the omission of many environmental costs from the end-use price of energy, both energy efficiency and renewable energy are economically under-valued. Further, political opposition by affected industries have forced some energy efficiency measures--such as an increase in fuel economy standards--completely off the table.

DRILL IN DETROIT: WE MUST INCREASE THE FUEL ECONOMY OF OUR VEHICLES

Mr. Chairman, there is no way that we can drill our way out of the economic, environmental, and political difficulty caused by our dependence on oil supplies and the inevitable rise of our level of imports past 60 percent. U.S. domestic oil production has fallen steadily since 1970 and will continue to fall inexorably over time whether we drill in the Arctic, on the Rocky Mountain Front, or under this building. Our greatest, most available untapped domestic source of oil is that which we waste by failing to adopt existing energy saving- technologies in our light duty vehicles. We have the technology to significantly improve fuel economy and reduce pressure on international oil prices by cutting domestic oil demand. Over the past 20 years, advanced transmissions, ignitions, lightweight (but strong) materials, hybrid electric drive trains, and other technologies have shown that significantly improving fuel economy is no longer a technological obstacle. It's the political obstacle that remains, Mr. Chairman. If all of the vehicles in the U.S. averaged 40 miles per gallon (mpg) we would save over 3 million barrels of oil each day, more than the United States currently imports from the Persian Gulf and could ever extract from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, combined. Getting 40 mpg would cut global warming pollution by 600 million tons a year and save consumers more than $45 billion each year at the gas pump. Mr. Chairman, new research shows that advanced technologies and engineering strategies largely put to rest the claim that increasing fuel economy necessarily decreases auto safety. Auto safety is a question of the specific engineering of vehicles, not a simple inverse relationship between size and weight. In fact, recent research by Dr. David Greene at Oak Ridge National Laboratory shows that much of the safety data that had been used to fight increases in fuel economy has been misinterpreted and misused over the years. While we must continue to make our vehicles safer for our families, we can make strides toward more fuel efficiency at the same time. Further, while they might disagree, we believe that the adoption of new technology is critical to providing consumers what they want and maintaining the competitiveness of the domestic auto industry. In an echo of the 1970s, resistance by domestic manufacturers to incorporating hybrid electric drive technology in vehicles has allowed Honda and Toyota to jump way ahead in the marketing of hybrid vehicles. Thus far, hybrids have proven very popular and many models have waiting lists of many months. The addition of the Ford Escape hybrid SUV last summer was a positive development, and the strong demand has encouraged them to increase their production for 2005. By failing to get serious about reducing demand for oil in our transportation system, we set up a situation where our only alternative is to diplomatically or--if necessary--militarily secure oil supplies from other nations, opening worldwide supply lines to attack or disruption by terrorists. Mr. Chairman, without an aggressive program to reduce demand and insulate our economy from price and supply shocks, we may doom ourselves to fight one oil war after another after another in order to allow our citizens to maintain their lifestyle. Mr. Chairman, that is not a situation I want for my children, and one that I believe is not necessary if we pursue cost-effective options available to us.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY: A POWERFUL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOL

Mr. Chairman, I was pleased to see recently that you have joined the leadership of the Alliance to Save Energy as a vice-chair. Before joining the Sierra Club, I was policy director of the Alliance for eight and a half years. Your contribution to that fine organization displays your understanding and appreciation for the broad-based economic power of using energy more efficiently. Too often, Mr. Chairman, people view energy efficiency as doing little things to save a nickel here and dime there. But as you understand through your work with the Alliance, energy efficiency is a potent, powerful tool for economic development and environmental protection that showers benefits across economic sectors, creates jobs for American workers, makes us more competitive internationally, and offers solutions to many of the problems of our energy system discussed previously. In addition, too many people consider demand and supply side options as wholly different things. As you know, and the Alliance to Save Energy trumpets every day, energy efficiency programs extend and increase energy supply just as surely as if we pumped it out of the ground or mined it. In fact, it can increase energy supply more cheaply than building new power plants or sinking new oil and gas wells. Unfortunately, H.R 6 fails to exploit energy efficiency to a meaningful degree. There are useful provisions, such as the addition of a variety of products for which the Department of Energy must set energy standards and roughly $3 billion over 5 years for highly efficient products and practices. Overall, however, Mr. Chairman, the bill fails to pursue energy efficiency commensurate with other energy sources or do more than scratch the surface of the potential benefits available from using energy more efficiently. The American Council for An Energy Efficient Economy estimates that the energy efficiency provisions in H.R. 6 would improve our nation's overall efficiency level by a mere 1.5 percent over an 18 year period. By contrast, aggressive energy efficiency efforts in states like Vermont and California are currently achieving electric efficiency gains of greater than 1 percent per year. In his testimony before your Committee last week, ACEEE Executive Director Steven Nadel described their research on the potential effect of aggressive energy efficiency programs on natural gas prices. ACEEE concluded that achieving a savings target of 4 percent per year can result in a 25 percent reduction in natural gas prices and a national economic savings of $100 billion by 2010. No proposed means of simply increasing gas supply has the potential to provide the same level of benefits to American families and the environment. In October, 2004, Mr. Chairman, the research organization Redefining Progress released a study that detailed the potential economic results of a suite of energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The results of the Redefining Progress report showed that making the kind of investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy that are available to us now would result in the creation of 1.4 million new jobs over and above the business as usual case by 2025. In addition American families would achieve an average household savings on energy costs of $1,275 per year while the nation would benefit from reduced foreign oil dependence and significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Chairman, with potential results for American families like these on the table, strong clean energy policies should be a no- brainer for the nation. There are a variety of options that have been proposed to better exploit potential energy efficiency resources in the electric sector. Those include an energy efficiency standard structured similarly to the one in Texas, or a public benefits fund that mirrors many of the most effective efficiency programs currently being carried out in a variety of other states. The Alliance to Save Energy estimates that a national public benefits fund would save 440 billion kWh per year, reduce peak electricity demand by 160,000 MW (the equivalent of 503 300MW power plants), save consumers a net $68 billion dollars, and prevent annual carbon dioxide emissions of 96 million metric tons by 2020. We urge that the Committee incorporate such ambitious energy efficiency provisions in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Such measures would begin to balance the bill's myriad benefits for energy industries with ones that benefit the American public.

RENEWABLE ENERGY: CLEAN POWER FOR THE FUTURE

Mr. Chairman, the Senate has twice sent a proposal for a renewable energy standard to the House, only to have it removed in a Conference Committee. We applaud the inclusion of the renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) in H.R. 6, which both extends the tax credit for the production of electricity by wind energy and broadens that credit to include additional renewable energy sources. If the nation is to take global warming seriously, however, we need to maximize the future share of our electricity that will come from clean renewable sources. The Senate provision would require electricity companies to increase the share of renewable energy in the mix of their power sales to 10 percent by 2020. The enactment of this provision would increase renewable energy electricity production in the U.S. from about 18,000 megawatts in 2002 to approximately 80,000 megawatts in 2020. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) analysis found that the Senate-passed 10 percent renewable electricity standard, in combination with the expanded and extended PTC, would result in a $12.6 billion savings for consumers and taxpayers through 2020. The Sierra Club strongly urges the incorporation of a renewable energy standard at least as strong as that passed twice by the Senate. The benefits of renewable energy will accrue to future generations as the low environmental and fuel cost of the power becomes more fairly valued. These young industries deserve at least the consideration given to nuclear energy by the federal government in the 1950s, when it passed measures to assist that industry.

ENVIRONMENTALLY HARMFUL PROVISIONS OF H.R. 6

Providing an in-depth analysis of the environmentally damaging provisions of H.R. 6 would have been such an extensive and discouraging task, that I appreciate the Committee's permission to a give a broader treatment of what we believe the energy bill should look like. We cannot turn away, however, from a set of provisions that constitute an aggressive attack on environmental protection in the U.S. We urge that the Committee reconsider and remove the following provisions from the successor to H.R. 6. While we have no illusions that this will take place, this assault on the environment in the name of increased energy production should not go forward. Most of the following proposals do not serve the American public or solve our nation's major energy-related problems. The continued inclusion of the vast majority of these provisions will secure the continued opposition of the Sierra Club to House energy legislation.

Damaging Public Health --Allows more smog pollution for longer than the current Clean Air Act --Exempts all oil and gas construction activities from certain stormwater runoff provisions of the Clean Water Act --Delays air pollution clean up in southwestern Michigan for two years. --Dramatically increases air and global warming pollution with incentives for burning coal, oil and gas. --Inhibits deployment of ``clean coal'' by disqualifying federally- funded clean coal projects as ``best available control technologies'' that must be adopted by other coal-powered industrial facilities. --Threatens drinking water sources. --Fails to ban MTBE --Gives legal protection and exemption to owners of abandoned oil and gas wells. --Encourages the mixture of hazardous wastes in concrete products as an alternative to safe disposal. --Fails to include standards for providing clean, renewable energy sources. --Allows electric utilities to enter into emission trading with mobile sources. --Fails to do anything to address global warming. --Provides millions in taxpayer funds to uranium companies for polluting mining practices that threaten drinking water aquifers. --Sets dangerous precedent for arbitrarily reclassifying radioactive waste.

Attacking Public Lands and Resources --Allows the Interior Secretary to designate utility and pipeline corridors across public lands without seeking public input. --Opens the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska for oil and gas production. --Allows the Secretary of Energy to permit electric power lines across federal public lands. --Allows applicants for federal drilling permits to take up to two years to comply with application requirements --Expedites the permitting and completion of energy projects on federal lands. --Requires the U.S. Geological Survey to identify ``restrictions and impediments'' to the development of federal oil and gas deposits. --Expedites the approval of energy projects in the Rocky Mountain region. --Lifts the limitation on the amount of federal oil and gas acreage one entity can control, encouraging monopolization. --Mandates the siting of a high voltage electricity transmission line through the Cleveland National Forest and other public lands. --Encourages oil and gas development under Padre Island National Seashore. --Waives existing National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) environmental review and public participation process for all types of energy development projects on Indian lands. --Grants the hydropower industry unprecedented rights to appeal environmental --Authorizes $550 million for timber companies to log trees in our national forests --Permits activation of an energy cable that is running the length of the Long Island Sound and that is in violation of both state and federal permits.

Attacking Coastal Areas --Seeks to create unprecedented streamlined authority for the Department of Interior to permit new energy projects in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). --Weakens states' ability to have a say in projects and federal activities that affect their coasts. --Circumvents the environmental review process for construction of storage facilities and terminals for LNG on the OCS --Creates incentives for expanded offshore oil and gas drilling. --Promotes coastal drilling through revenue sharing --Gives away taxpayer owned oil and gas to the petroleum industry in fragile Alaskan waters. --Promotes the development of all Outer Continental Shelf lands through two ill-defined studies of energy resources within the OCS.

Hurting Consumers &amp; Taxpayers --Gives billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies to energy companies. --Tax breaks are even provided for technologies that will increase pollution, including

creating a program to assist and encourage companies to develop ``ultra deepwater and unconventional'' gas reserves. mandating royalty exemptions for offshore wells deeper than 400 meters; allows the Secretary of the Interior to reimburse oil and gas companies for environmental review of their projects; creating a new, first-ever $1.5 billion tax break for burning coal, --Requires taxpayers to pay up to $2 billion to clean up leaking underground storage tanks. --Provides $2 billion in ``MTBE Conversion Assistance'' for oil companies. --Preempts state authority to site transmission lines, based on very vague criteria, for every state but Texas. --Extends for 20 years the limits on liability for nuclear plant operators in case of a catastrophic accident. --Repeals the PUHCA, the main law to protect consumers from market manipulation, fraud, and abuse in the electricity sector. --Authorizes a $1.1 billion nuclear reactor in Idaho, with a potential exemption from Federal management rules. --Leaves landowners, ranchers and others affected by oil and gas development powerless to protect their land and water from development activities. --Waives existing law and mandates expeditious oil and gas leasing throughout the NPR-A, and allows for waivers of all royalties due the taxpayers as a result of leasing of these lands. --Spends $3.7 billion for polluting coal-based technologies. --Allows the Interior Department to reimburse the oil and gas industry from federal royalty revenues for the costs of environmental analyses. --Reverses the Federal Power Act's consumer protection requirements by allowing parties to enter into contracts that can only be challenged by the Federal Regulatory Commission prospectively. --Authorizes the Energy Department to provide open-ended U.S. loan guarantees for coal-to-synthetic-diesel fuel projects. --Allows the Interior Department to compensate oil and gas companies 115 percent of the costs of cleaning up abandoned wells on public lands. --Limits the Bureau of Land Management's ability to receive fair market value for utility corridors crossing public lands. --Gives production tax credits to conventional nuclear reactor. --Increases the burden of proof on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in cases of investigations of market manipulation and/or reports to investors.

      <text>STATEMENT OF NAVIN NAYAK

Mr. Nayak. Thank you very much. Again, as you mentioned, I am with the U.S. Public Interest Research Group; we are the national advocacy office for the State PIRGs. The State PIRGs are State-based advocacy groups that work on environmental, good government and consumer issues. We appreciate the opportunity to speak today, and we hope and expect that our view and the view of other citizen groups will be considered as Congress moves forward and this committee moves forward with energy legislation. Before I get to the nuclear provisions, I would like to just speak briefly about the kind of energy bill that we would like to see. I think we agree, as I am sure all Members of Congress do, with the President's desire for a reliable supply of affordable, environmentally responsible energy. The primary goals of any energy policy should be to make our Nation more secure and less dependent on foreign energy to reduce the energy costs to all consumers and to minimize the harmful public health impacts and environmental impacts of energy production and consumption. I believe that we are all united on those goals. Unfortunately, the energy bill that the President supports, that the Congress tried to pass last year, which was twice- rejected by the Senate, which is very similar to the one currently introduced as a discussion draft, would fail on all accounts. According to the Department of Energy's own analysis by the Energy Information Administration, under the energy bill, the U.S. would increase its imports of foreign oil by 85 percent. Far from making us more secure and independent, the energy bill would make us less secure and more dependent on foreign sources of energy than we are today. Furthermore, the EIA concluded the energy bill would have no change in production, consumption, or prices. When the Department of Energy's own analysis concludes that the energy bill will not help consumers or reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign oil, it is time for Congress to reverse course and move toward an energy policy that makes us genuinely safe and more secure. The 3 things I would highlight, very quickly, in terms of an energy policy: we would like to see, as I mentioned, energy policy should reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The National Commission on Energy Policy, which included representatives from Exelon, from labor and from an environmental group, recommended that we reduce our dependence by 3 to 5 million barrels per day by 2025. That would reduce our dependence by 15 percent. Another component should be substantially increasing our investment in renewable energy. The oil, gas, coal, and nuclear industries have received $500 billion in Federal subsidies over the last 50 years, whereas renewables have received about 25 billion. Eighteen States have passed renewable energy standards which would substantially increase their investment in renewable energy. We have released a report today, which coincides with many other reports, showing that investing in renewable energy would create jobs, save consumers money, reduce our dependence on natural gas, and provide substantial environmental benefits. And the last component, very quickly, is to address the concern around global warming. Today, as the Kyoto Protocol takes effect, 137 other countries are moving forward, and we have not. I will spend the remainder of my testimony talking about our concerns on the nuclear provisions. Nuclear power is not safe. It is not economical. It is not reliable, and it is not necessary. All aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle pose a risk to humans and the environment, and nuclear power generates long- lived radioactive wastes for which there is no safe solution. With 103 reactors, the U.S. produces nearly twice as much nuclear waste as any other country, creating the largest nuclear waste disposal problem in the world. And no country in the world has yet found a permanent solution to this problem. We have not built a plant, as Mr. Kane referenced, in nearly 30 years, and the energy bill would very well be the most consorted effort to a nuclear relapse. The 2 things I would highlight: since the mid-1970's, the U.S. has kept a very strong policy of separating commercial reactors from the creation of plutonium. And for the last 2 decades, we have had a policy against reprocessing waste from commercial reactors. The advanced fuel cycle recycling program, which is funded substantially in the energy bill, specifically reverses this decade-long U.S. policy against reprocessing commercial waste. For security, economic, and environmental reasons, we urge Congress to end funding for that program. And then, my second point I will raise is around the economics. Nuclear power would, quite simply, would not exist in this country if were not for the enormous subsidies paid for by rate payers and taxpayers. From over $70 billion in research and development subsidies to a special taxpayer-backed insurance policy, known as Price Anderson, to unjustified electricity rates, nuclear power has received a substantial portion of Federal subsidies. The energy bill extends existing subsidies and creates new ones, including, and I will just highlight a few, as much as $6 billion tax credit, and this would be in addition to the high cost that the energy bill already had. The estimation last year was that the energy bill would cost $26 billion in tax credits. That did not include that $6 billion tax credit that would have taken effect if the energy had passed and the nuclear power plants were built. In addition to that, a $1 billion subsidy to build a reactor in Idaho, as well as an extension for another 20 years of the Price Anderson Act, which substantially reduces the costs of industry in the fact that they do not have to go on the private market to obtain insurance. In conclusion, I would just like to say that we do need to address the serious energy problem facing this country. From reducing costs to reducing our dependence on foreign oil to reducing the public health and environmental impacts. We cannot continue to the same things we have done for 50 years and expect different results, nor can we ignore this problem and pass an unstable energy future onto our children. Congress needs to address our energy problems and move us to a genuinely safe and secure energy future. And again, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today. [The prepared statement of Navin Nayak follows:]

Prepared Statement of Navin Nayak, Environmental Advocate, U.S. Public Interest Research Group


Good morning, my name is Navin Nayak and I'm an Environmental Advocate with the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, or U.S. PIRG. U.S. PIRG is the national office for the State PIRGs, which are environmental, good government and consumer advocacy groups active around the country. The State PIRGs have more than 300,000 members across the country. I appreciate the opportunity to speak before the Committee and to present our views on the energy bill before Congress. We hope and expect that our views, and the views of other citizen groups, will be reflected in the final bill. The state PIRGs have a long history of working for a clean affordable and safe energy future. Our goal is to reduce America's dependence on fossil fuels and nuclear power by increasing our production of clean renewable energy and the efficiency of our energy system. We agree, as I'm sure all Members of Congress do, with the President's desire for a ``reliable supply of affordable, environmentally responsible energy.'' The primary goals of energy policy should be to make our nation more secure and less dependent on foreign energy, to reduce the energy costs on all consumers-- residences, commercial, industrial--and to minimize the harmful public health and environmental impacts of energy production and consumption. I believe that we are all united in wanting to achieve these goals. Unfortunately, the energy bill that the President supports, and Congress tried to pass last year (H.R.6), which is similar to the 2005 Energy Policy Act recently introduced in the House, would fail on all counts. According to the Department of Energy's analytical agency--the Energy Information Administration (EIA)--under the energy bill the U.S. would increase its imports of foreign oil by 85 percent.SUP1/SUP Far from making us more secure or more independent, the energy bill would make us less secure and more dependent on foreign sources of energy than we are today. Furthermore, the EIA concluded that under the energy bill ``changes to production, consumption and prices [would be] negligible.'' In addition to increasing America's dependence on foreign oil, the energy bill would provide no relief to consumers and businesses. From an economic and consumer perspective, the Department of Energy's analysis concludes that the energy bill would be completely ineffectual. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/servicerpt/pceb/pdf/ sroiaf(2004)02.pdf --------------------------------------------------------------------------- When the Department of Energy's own analysis concludes that the energy bill will not help consumers or reduce our dependence on oil, it is time for Congress to reverse course and move towards an energy policy that will make us genuinely safe and secure.

AN ENERGY POLICY THAT WORKS

Fortunately, there is no shortage of solutions and policies that can meet the goals of a good energy policy. I would like to highlight just 3 provisions that should be integral to an energy policy that moves America forward--all of which are lacking in the current energy bill.

1) Reduced Dependence on Oil According to the EIA, the United States consumed 19.61 million barrels of petroleum per day in 2002. This is projected to grow to 28.3 million barrels per day by 2025 if we do not take action. Moreover, the U.S. only possesses 3 percent of all known oil reserves in the world, and the EIA predicts that after peaking in 2008, domestic crude oil production will decrease to 5.93 million barrels per day in 2010. Congress must deal with the country's oil deficit by reducing America's dependence on oil; we cannot ignore this problem and pass an unstable energy future on to our children. Simply calling for increased drilling on public and private lands would do nothing more than delay the inevitable need to reduce our dependence on oil. The National Commission on Energy Policy, which included representatives from industry, labor and an environmental group, recommended that we set a national goal of reducing our dependence on oil by 3-5 million barrels per day by 2025. This would cut America's oil dependence by nearly 15 percent of projected levels in 2025. The National Academy of Sciences concluded that it is economically feasible to double the efficiency of our vehicles in the next 10 years using existing technology; this would allow cars to get 40 mpg and would reduce America's dependence on oil by 4 million barrels per day by 2020. The energy bill before Congress would move us in the opposite direction, increasing U.S. imports of oil by 85 percent. If Congress is sincere about making this country more secure and safe, it must include a provision that will set a strong enforceable standard for reducing America's dependence on oil.

2) Renewable Energy Standard According to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. has the technical potential to generate four times our total current electricity use from renewable energy. Currently, only 2 percent of our electricity comes from sources such as wind, solar, geothermal and biomass, and more than 90 percent of the country's electricity comes from polluting and dangerous sources of energy such as nuclear, coal, oil and gas. Investing in renewable energy would avoid the negative public health and environmental impacts associated with burning fossil fuels and generating nuclear power. Several reports, including an analysis by EIA, have concluded that producing 20 percent of the nation's electricity by 2020 is an affordable and achievable goal. Moreover, numerous economic analyses-- including one released by U.S. PIRG today entitled Redirecting America's Energy: The Economic and Consumer Benefits of Clean Energy Policies--demonstrate that investing in renewable energy would create hundreds of thousands of new jobs, reduce demand for natural gas saving consumers billions of dollars, and alleviate the public health and environmental impacts of burning fossil fuels. In fact, we found that passing a renewable energy standard and investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency would create twice as many jobs and save consumers more than twice as much on natural gas and electricity than the energy bill. The best way to increase electricity generation from clean renewable energy is to pass a renewable energy standard (often called a renewable portfolio standard) requiring that a fixed percentage of our electricity come from renewable energy by a certain date. In the absence of federal action, several states across the country have moved forward by passing renewable energy standards. In November, the voters in Colorado supported an initiative to increase Colorado's production of renewable energy to 10 percent by 2015. Seventeen other states have already passed renewable energy standards including Texas, Hawaii, New Mexico, New York. If America is going to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and nuclear power, and move towards a safe and clean energy future, the energy bill should, at the very least, include a national renewable energy standard of 10 percent by 2015, similar to the one that has passed the Senate.

3) Global Warming Today, February 16, 2005, will be remembered as the day the rest of the world moved forward to protect their citizens from the threat of global warming. One hundred and thirty seven countries signed the Kyoto Protocol, which comes into effect today. The United States, however, has ignored the international scientific and political consensus that global warming is a serious current and future problem that requires immediate action. Human activities over the last century--particularly the burning of fossil fuels--have changed the composition of the atmosphere in ways that threaten to dramatically alter the global climate in the years to come. Global warming is caused by the greenhouse effect, a natural phenomenon in which gases in the Earth's atmosphere, including water vapor and carbon dioxide, trap heat from the sun near the planet's surface. Without a natural greenhouse effect, temperatures on Earth would be too cold for life to survive. Over the last century, however, the chemical makeup of the Earth's atmosphere has been changing, largely as a result of humans burning fossil fuels, which releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Since the industrial revolution, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 have increased by 31 percent.SUP2/SUP Concentrations of other greenhouse gases have increased as well. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC Third Assessment Report--Climate Change 2001: Summary for Policy Makers, 2001. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- These atmospheric changes have intensified the greenhouse effect, allowing less of the sun's heat to escape the Earth's atmosphere. Global average temperatures increased during the 20th century by more than 0.6 C (1 F), with the rate of change for the period since 1976 roughly three times that for the past 100 years as a whole.SUP3/SUP According to the United Nations' World Meteorological Organization, 2004 was the fourth hottest year ever recorded, and the 1990s were the warmest decade since measurements began in 1861.SUP4/SUP If current trends continue, temperatures could rise by an additional 1.4 C to 5.8 C from 1990 to 2100.SUP5/SUP --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC Third Assessment Report--Climate Change 2001: Summary for Policy Makers, 2001; and World Meteorological Organization, United Nations, WMO Statement on the Status of the Global Climate in 2004: Global Temperature in 2004 Fourth Warmest (press release), 15 December 2004, downloaded from www.wmo.ch/index-en.html, 5 January 2005. \4\ World Meteorological Organization, United Nations, WMO Statement on the Status of the Global Climate in 2004: Global Temperature in 2004 Fourth Warmest (press release), 15 December 2004, downloaded from www.wmo.ch/index-en.html, 5 January 2005. \5\ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC Third Assessment Report--Climate Change 2001: Summary for Policy Makers, 2001. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The consequences of the increase in global temperatures will vary from place to place because the Earth's climate is extraordinarily complex. According to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the most authoritative source on global warming, among the changes that could occur include sea level rise of up to three feet by 2100; heat waves; drought; increasingly intense tropical storms; loss of plant and animal species; decreased crop yields; decreased water availability; and the spread of infectious diseases.SUP6/SUP --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \6\ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC Third Assessment Report--Climate Change 2001: Summary for Policy Makers, 2001. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The first signs of global warming are already evident in the U.S. and worldwide. For instance, in Montana's Glacier National Park, the largest glaciers are only about one-third the size they were in 1850, and many small mountain glaciers have disappeared completely. The area of the park covered by glaciers declined by 73 percent from 1850 to 1993, and scientists estimate that the park's glaciers will disappear entirely by 2030. Meanwhile, average summer temperatures in the park have increased by about 1.8 F since 1900.SUP7/SUP --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \7\ EPA, Global Warming--Impacts, Western Mountains (fact sheet), downloaded from http://yosemite.epa.gov/oar/globalwarming.nsf/content/ ImpactsMountainsWesternMountains.html#changingeco, 5 January 2005. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Along the Atlantic coast, nine hurricanes struck the U.S. in 2004, causing extensive damage estimated at more than $43 billion.SUP8/SUP According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the intensity of hurricanes increases as levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide increase.SUP9/SUP Across the Atlantic, a landmark study recently found that human influences on the climate system more than doubled the risk of a heat wave like the one that killed 22,000 to 35,000 Europeans in 2003.SUP10/SUP --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \8\ World Meteorological Organization, United Nations, WMO Statement on the Status of the Global Climate in 2004: Global Temperature in 2004 Fourth Warmest (press release), 15 December 2004, downloaded from www.wmo.ch/index-en.html, 5 January 2005. \9\ Thomas R.

For instance, the average extent of sea-ice cover in the summer has declined by 15 to 20 percent in the last 30 years. Among other impacts, the reduction in sea ice ``will drastically shrink marine habitat for polar bears, ice- inhabiting seals, and some seabirds, pushing some species to extinction.'' SUP12/SUP The report concludes that some continued warming is inevitable given the buildup of carbon dioxide but says that the ``speed and amount'' of warming can be minimized by substantially reducing future emissions.SUP13/SUP --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \11\ The Arctic Council, Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, 2004, 8. \12\ The Arctic Council, Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, 2004, 10. \13\ The Arctic Council, Impacts of a Warming Arctic: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, 2004, 9. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Instead of applying the country's technological know-how to address the challenges of global warming, Congress has chosen to ignore the threat, calling for more research on a problem that is already clearly defined and relying entirely on voluntary industry initiatives to merely reduce the rate of increase in global warming emissions. Moreover, Congress is pushing an energy policy that would do nothing to cap emissions of global warming pollution and would in fact increase

our dependence on the fossil fuels responsible for the problem. We urge Congress to include a mandatory cap on carbon emissions similar to the Gilchrest-Olver proposal introduced in the House. To make America more secure and move us toward energy independence, Congress must include these three critical provisions in any comprehensive energy legislation. These provisions are certainly not an exhaustive list; for example, we should also increase energy efficiency standards and incentives for appliances, homes and buildings, and create mandatory reliability standards for the electricity grid. Reducing America's dependence on oil, substantially increasing our production of clean renewable energy, and addressing the threat of global warming should be the necessary pillars upon which any energy bill is built. The energy bill currently before this Committee and which Congress rejected last year would include none of these positive steps forward. In fact, the energy bill includes several harmful provisions that will weaken landmark environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, force states, counties and municipalities to shoulder the expensive clean-up costs surrounding MTBE contamination of drinking water, and provide billions of dollars in subsidies for the coal, nuclear, oil and gas industries. Our organization has expressed our concerns on these issues at length in other places SUP14/SUP; I will focus the remainder of my testimony on the nuclear provisions in the energy bill. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \14\ http://newenergyfuture.com/newenergy.asp?id2=11128 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- NUCLEAR POWER

Nuclear power is not safe, not reliable, not economical, and not necessary. All aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle pose a risk to humans and the environment. Nuclear power generates long-lived radioactive wastes for which there is no safe solution. Nuclear power should be phased out as soon as possible and should not be encouraged as a future energy source.

NUCLEAR POWER IS NOT SAFE OR CLEAN

In light of growing public concern about air pollution and global

warming, the nuclear power industry has undertaken a slick advertising campaign to market itself as a safe and clean energy source. Nuclear power is in fact one of the most dangerous and polluting energy sources. Nuclear waste is one of the most dangerous substances created by humans; unshielded, nuclear waste delivers a lethal dose of radiation within seconds. This waste remains dangerous for at least a quarter of a million years (based on the decay of Pu-239). According to the Department of Energy, 95% of the radioactive waste (by radioactivity) in this country has been generated by commercial nuclear reactors. With 103 reactors, the U.S. produces nearly twice as much nuclear waste as any other country--creating the largest nuclear waste disposal problem in the world. No country in the world has a permanent solution to this problem. The current proposal to develop Yucca Mountain as a repository remains marred in serious legal problems. For example a recent federal district court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency did not adhere to the National Academy of Science's guidelines that the site be safe throughout the full period of risk. We urge Congress to ensure that scientific integrity is maintained for this project and that the National Academy of Science's guideline is not ignored. In addition to the public health and environmental concerns accompanying the development of Yucca Mountain, the site will not be able to contain the full amount of nuclear waste generated. In fact, by 2011 the nuclear reactors in the U.S. are projected to have produced 63,000 MT of nuclear waste--the projected capacity of Yucca Mountain. With existing plants already licensed to continue operating--and producing waste--beyond 2011, it is unclear how the federal government will dispose of the excess waste. The federal government should cease building any more nuclear power plants which will only generate severe disposal problems for future generations. In light of the extensive array of energy alternatives available, it is completely unacceptable that the federal government would support generating thousands of tons of deadly radioactive waste to power our homes and turn on our computers.

NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS THREATEN NEARBY COMMUNITIES

Nuclear power plants are very complex and contain enormous amounts of potential energy in the fuel at the core of the reactor. The most tragic example of the dangers posed by this technology is the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl reactor in the Ukraine. The explosion and core meltdown at Chernobyl released radiation that generated a plume encompassing the entire Northern Hemisphere SUP15/SUP. Here in the U.S., in addition to the partial core meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979, which forced the evacuation of nearly one hundred fifty thousand people, there have been four other nuclear accidents in the U.S. involving at least partial core meltdown.SUP16/SUP --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \15\ OECD Nuclear Energy Agency report ``Chernobyl Ten Years On, Radiological and Health Impact'', November 1995. \16\ Public Citizen website http://www.citizen.org/Press/pr- cmep84.htm --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The potential consequences of a serious accident are staggering. A 1982 study by the Sandia National Laboratories found that a serious accident at a U.S. nuclear reactor could cause hundreds to thousands of deaths in the near term.SUP17/SUP --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \17\ Union of Concerned Scientists, Nuclear Plant Safety: Will the Luck Run Out? December 15, 1998 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- We are concerned that utility deregulation and new ownership of reactors may increase risks of accidents because of increased pressure to run the plants closer to the margin. This risk is heightened by the fact that the 103 operating reactors around the country are deteriorating with age more quickly than expected. Even Vice President Cheney acknowledged the aging problem on the television show ``Hardball'' (March 21, 2001): ``[T]oday nuclear power--produces 20 percent of our electricity, but that's going to go down over time-- because some of these plants are wearing out.'' Despite industry's claims that nuclear power is ``safe,'' at least ten existing reactors have experiencing aging-related shutdowns since January 2000.SUP18/SUP The events at the Davis-Besse reactor in Ohio highlight the seriousness of the problem regarding the safety of nuclear reactors. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \18\ Union of Concerned Scientists, ``Aging Nuclear Plants and License Renewal,'' Issue Brief, May 22, 2001 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In November of 2001, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) allowed FirstEnergy, the owner of the Davis-Besse plant in Ohio to ignore warning signs, then delay a shutdown for three months. Inspectors found a six-inch hole in the reactor cover that had only millimeters left until it breached the cover. According to interviews with NRC personnel, the agency backed down from issuing a safety- related shutdown order after FirstEnergy argued vigorously against a shutdown at that time because they didn't want bad publicity nor a drop in their financial ratings. At least one NRC employee felt that the company withheld important information about evidence of serious corrosion.SUP19/SUP The NRC's decision to let the plant operate and rake in profits a few months longer even with evidence of serious problems jeopardized the health and safety of the surrounding communities. First Energy is currently under a grand jury investigation related to the events at Davis-Besse. Events such as these underscore the severe security risk posed by nuclear power plants. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \19\ Nuclear Regulatory Commission Inspector General Interviews on Davis-Besse http://www.ucsusa.org/clean--energy/nuclear--safety/ page.cfm?pageID=1123 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONGRESS SHOULD OPPOSE PROGRAMS, WHICH INCREASE THE THREAT OF NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION

Plutonium, an element that can only be produced in nuclear reactors, is the material of choice for nuclear weapons. All reactors produce it, but it must be separated from highly radioactive irradiated fuel before it can be used in weapons. This separation process is known as ``reprocessing.'' For at least two decades, the United States has had a policy against reprocessing waste from commercial nuclear reactors and not allowing plutonium to be used as fuel in nuclear reactors to prevent the proliferation of weapons-usable material. The Advanced Fuel Recycling Program specifically reverses the decades-long U.S. policy against reprocessing commercial nuclear waste. It advocates reprocessing commercial nuclear fuel and using several types of reactors to allegedly reduce the volume and toxicity of the waste. A January 2003 report, entitled ``Report to Congress on Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative: The Future Path for Advanced Spent Fuel Treatment and Transmutation Research,'' admits that this costly program will not obviate the need for a geologic repository. Further it contradicts itself with regard to nuclear non-proliferation. First, it claims that the program can ``destroy'' plutonium thus reducing the risks of this material falling into the wrong hands.SUP20/SUP On the same page, however, it touts the potential for a commercial nuclear fuel cycle based on the plutonium separated from existing irradiated fuel--a program that would dramatically increase the risk of weapons materials falling into the wrong hands by putting separated plutonium into commercial nuclear reactors. We urge Congress to end funding for the advanced fuel cycle initiative. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \20\ Report to Congress on Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative: The Future Path for Advanced Spent Fuel Treatment and Transmutation Research, DOE, January 2003, p. II-6. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- NUCLEAR POWER IS NOT ECONOMICAL

Nuclear power would not exist in this country today if it were not for enormous subsidies paid for by ratepayers and taxpayers. Originally touted as being ``too cheap to meter,'' nuclear power has proven to be too expensive to afford. The nuclear industry has received the vast majority of energy research and development funding, a special taxpayer-backed insurance policy known as the Price Anderson Act, unjustified electric rates from state regulators, enormous and unwarranted bailouts in state deregulation plans, and ultimately a taxpayer-funded nuclear waste dump. The industry has not been able to build a new plant in thirty years because private investors believe that nuclear power is a risky and uneconomical investment. Even after fifty years of constant federal support, the nuclear industry is incapable of building new plants on its own, and since private investors have shown disinterest, the industry is now asking taxpayers for new handouts. DOE commissioned a report by Scully Capital called ``Business Case for New Nuclear Power Plants,'' SUP21/SUP which concludes that existing taxpayer backed insurance (known as the Price Anderson Act), federal research and development funds and ultimately federally-funded nuclear waste program are not enough to make these new reactors cost- competitive. Instead it recommends a mind-boggling suite of new subsidies including: a federal energy credit program, low interest loans, power purchase agreements (at up to 50% more than market rates), emissions credits and additional insurance. This report estimates that the federal government would have to spend at least $1.5 to 2.75 billion in subsidies to bring down the capital costs of five new nuclear plants. This estimate does not include any additional subsidies for nuclear waste disposal, siting and permitting the new plants. The energy bill extends existing subsidies and creates new ones for the nuclear industry. I outline below of few of the most unjustified and costly subsidies below: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \21\ http://www.nuclear.gov/home/bc/businesscase.html --------------------------------------------------------------------------- CONGRESS SHOULD REMOVE THE $6 BILLION TAX GIVEAWAY

One of the primary obstacles to building new nuclear power plants in the U.S. is the large upfront capital cost of plants. With investors uninterested in bearing the financial risk, the federal energy bill uses taxpayer dollars to assist the industry. Specifically, the energy bill provides the nuclear industry with a production tax credit of 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour. Under the proposal, a 1000 megawatt (MW) nuclear power plant could claim an annual credit of up to $125 million over an eight year period for a total of $1 billion in federal support. The proposal allows for us to six 1000 MW plants to claim the credit, costing taxpayers as much as $6 billion. The Committee should strip this costly giveaway from the energy bill, particularly within the current budget climate.

CONGRESS SHOULD REMOVE THE $1 BILLION GIVEAWAY FOR THE IDAHO REACTOR

In addition to the $6 billion tax credit, Subtitle C-Advanced Reactor Hydrogen Cogeneration Project--provides $1.1 billion to build a nuclear reactor at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory that would attempt to co-general hydrogen. Specifically, the provision provides $500 million for construction and $635 million plus such sums as are necessary to research, develop and design the new plant. The federal government can actually fund two teams for one year to develop a proposal for building the reactor. Furthermore, the provision does not even require that the plant achieve its intended goal of producing electricity from nuclear power and hydrogen. ``The overall project, which may involve demonstration of selected project objectives in a partner nation, must demonstrate both electricity and hydrogen production.'' It makes little sense from a policy perspective to tie the promise of hydrogen as a clean energy source to the most dangerous and historically most expensive energy source. We urge Congress to remove this over-priced boondoggle.

CONGRESS SHOULD NOT EXTEND PRICE ANDERSON ACT.

We oppose extension of the Price Anderson Act, which is an unwarranted taxpayer subsidy to the nuclear industry. This law, passed in 1957 and amended several times since, provides taxpayer-funded insurance for the nuclear industry in the event of an accident. In case of an accident at a nuclear power plant, the industry gets a guarantee of limited liability while the public gets no guarantee of full compensation. Instead of having to purchase insurance on the private market--as other countries have required the industry to do--the nuclear industry in the U.S. is provided a cap on their liability. This confers a substantial annual subsidy to the nuclear industry in terms of foregone insurance premiums, as well as reduced payments in the case of a serious accident. The Price-Anderson Act also provides blanket indemnity to Department of Energy contractors, even in cases of intentional misconduct and gross negligence. Price Anderson was passed as a temporary measure that was supposed to be phased out once the industry established sufficient confidence in the safety of its product. However, 50 years later the industry is still requesting that Congress extend Price Anderson. Existing plants are already covered under the law; yet the industry is requesting an extension to cover new plants. If the industry is confident in the safety of nuclear power they should be willing to fully insure their product instead of asking for federal assistance.

CONGRESS SHOULD OPPOSE NUCLEAR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING.

According to the Congressional Research Service, the federal government provided the nuclear industry with more than $70 billion in research and development subsidies or nearly 60 percent of all federal energy research and development funding between 1948-98. We are extremely disappointed that the subcommittee draft legislation includes authorization of nearly $2 billion in commercial nuclear research and development subsidies. The Department of Energy's own studies show that new reactors developed through taxpayer-funded programs such as Generation IV and Nuclear Power 2010 are not cost- competitive.SUP22/SUP The nuclear power industry is not a new or budding industry; after more than fifty years of research and development support, it is time to get the industry off of the federal dole. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \22\ http://www.nuclear.gov/nerac/ntdroadmapvolume1.pdf --------------------------------------------------------------------------- NUCLEAR POWER IS NOT NECESSARY

Nuclear power is not safe, not economic, and not necessary. Congress should do everything it can to protect the health and safety of the public as well as taxpayers. Nuclear power should be phased out as quickly as possible. By setting strong energy efficiency standards for homes, buildings, and appliances, and by increasing investments in energy efficiency, we can reduce our electricity use in the U.S. by 28 percent by 2020, according to conservative estimates. Instead of increasing federal support for building additional nuclear power

plants, we should pursue an aggressive and affordable strategy to increase America's production of renewable energy and invest in energy efficiency.

CONCLUSION

America needs an energy policy that will make our nation more secure and less dependent on foreign energy, reduce the energy costs on all consumers--residences, commercial, industrial--and minimize the harmful public health and environmental impacts of energy production and consumption. The energy bill before Congress would fail on all these counts. It is time for Congress to abandon the failed energy policies of the past century and redirect America's energy toward a safe, secure and affordable future.

      <text>STATEMENT OF BOB SLAUGHTER

Mr. Slaughter. Thank you, Chairman Hall, Chairman Barton, Congressman Boucher, and other members of the subcommittee. Thanks for allowing NPRA, again, to present its views on comprehensive energy legislation. As you know, our members include virtually all U.S. refiners, as well as most domestic petrochemical manufacturers. First, thanks to this subcommittee, the full committee, and the entire House for approving H.R. 6, three times in the previous Congress. You've done the lion's share of the work in advancing a supply based national energy policy. NPRA believe that this year in this Congress there is an excellent chance that a comprehensive energy bill quite similar to Energy Policy Act of 2005 will become law. The NPRA has the following specific recommendations regarding ways to ensure an abundant supply of transportation fuels and natural gas: repeal of the 2 percent RFG oxygenation requirement is needed to provide greater flexibility to refiners. Congress should make a clean break from overly prescriptive fuel policy by avoiding enactment of an ethanol mandate of MTBE ban. These intrusive actions add unnecessary costs and complications to the already difficult business of manufacturing gasoline in accordance with modern, environmentally sensitive fuel specification. Avoid prescriptive legislative action regarding boutique fuels, pending development of more accurate information on their cause, extent, and impact. The H.R. 6 Conference Report contained language ordering an EPA/DOE study of this phenomenon, and that is the only appropriate action at this time. Please take steps to increase domestic natural gas supply and to balance future gas supply and demand. It is time to review and curtail the practice of closing of promising areas on and offshore where production of domestic natural gas can proceed in an environmentally acceptable manner. The petrochemical industry, a $200 billion per year industry on which 150,000 good, American jobs depend, is one of many U.S. industries that rely on a secure, predictably priced supply of natural gas and its derivatives to do business in an increasingly competitive world market. Refiners are also significant users of natural gas. This means we need enhanced domestic production, plus LNG, plus Alaskan gas. We need them all and cannot afford to forego any of these crucial supply increments to maintain U.S. economic viability and environmental progress. We also would like to suggest that this subcommittee consider having a hearing on the recently completed National Petroleum Council study of the refining industry. That report's summary is attached to my testimony, and it makes many important recommendations about policy changes need to keep the domestic refining industry running strong and producing the lion's share of critical products like gasoline, diesel, and home-heating oil, right here in the United States. And last, but far from least, the NPRA urges you to include, once again, in this year's energy bill, the provision to provide limited liability protection for mandated fuel components MTBE and renewables. As you know, this provision affects only the defective products claim, leaving in place other traditional causes of action such as negligence and trespass. Those who are responsible for oxygen contamination of water remain explicitly liable for cleanup costs under this provision. Refiners and petrochemical manufactures worked hard with the EPA and other stakeholders to make the RFG program established by the 1990 Clean Air Amendments a success. They invested billions of dollars to make RFG as required by the Act, including the mandatory 2 percent oxygen content that was originally opposed by a near-unanimous refining industry. I, personally, lobbied against that provision at the time, in favor of performance standards rather than an oxygenic mandate. Nevertheless, industry made that program a success when Congress acted and the final regulation were in place. Everyone knew then that MTBE would be the most widely used oxygenate in the new RFG program. The sponsor of the provision said so during debate on the floor of the other body. The EPA had approved MTBE for use in gasoline, twice modeled its proposed RFG regulations explicitly around MTBE use to reflect this fact, while without the RFG program would have been infeasible. No alternate oxygenate was available at the time in sufficient quantity and at economically viable costs to provide the large volumes needed in the vast RFG program, which eventually

amounted to one-third of the Nation's gasoline supply. The U.S. refining industry spent approximately $47 billion in environmental expenditures in the last 2 decades and will spend about $20 billion in this decade to comply with new environmental requirements. Our members are committed to improving the Nation's air through compliance with EPA regulations which are usually quite prescriptive and challenging. The--in fact, the Clean Air Act would not be successful without the help and cooperation of industry and the implementation of new regulations. This is why the Energy Policy Act of 2005 should continue to provide as it does, a carefully tailored provision eliminating nuisance suits that seek to penalize the industry for complying with the clear intent of Congress in using MTBE, and EPA-approved gasoline component, to help clean the Nation's air. Thank you again for the opportunity to appear here, and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Bob Slaughter follows:]

Prepared Statement of Bob Slaughter, President, NPRA

Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the need for a comprehensive U.S. energy policy. My name is Bob Slaughter, and I am President of NPRA, the National Petrochemical &amp; Refiners Association. NPRA is a national trade association with about 450 members who own or operate virtually all U.S. refining capacity, as well as petrochemical manufacturers who operate similar manufacturing processes. NPRA's refining members include large integrated refiners, large independent refiners, regional independents, and small refiners. The refining and petrochemical industries produce clean transportation fuels to power today's sophisticated engines, provide a steady supply of home heating oil, and manufacture the basic building blocks of items that touch every aspect of our daily lives. The prospects for success in the refining and petrochemical industries are based upon the efficient, economic rearrangement of the links between hydrocarbon molecules. Our remarks today will concern links as well. There is a link between energy and economic strength for the United States; there is a link between energy and the continued development of innovation and discovery, and another link between energy and our national security. These links are in some jeopardy today. Our energy policies do not reflect the importance of supply. For too long government actions, especially in the environmental area, have inadequately balanced energy supply impacts with other policy objectives. NPRA supports the development and use of cleaner-burning fuels to meet health and environmental goals while maintaining adequate supplies to meet the demand of the motoring public and basic consumer. We believe that this can best be achieved if energy and environmental policymaking are integrated, and if the costs and benefits of new regulatory or legislative requirements are carefully analyzed and balanced so that any adverse impact on energy supplies is both assessed and mitigated. We urge caution in attempts to promote agriculture or social policy as part of this process. The politics of the moment often result in adoption of policies that run counter to overall national concerns and objectives. With these thoughts in mind, NPRA sincerely appreciates the opportunity to address the subcommittee today and to present our views on the need for comprehensive energy legislation. Simply stated, NPRA supports policies that both encourage the production of an abundant supply of petroleum-based products for U.S. consumers and that promote a robust and diverse energy supply mix for all sectors.

I. ENERGY POLICY

In March of 2003, nearly two years ago, NPRA also had the privilege to appear before the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality concerning this same subject. In summarizing NPRA's energy policy recommendations at that time, we urged Congress to: repeal the 2% RFG oxygenation requirement; avoid a federal ban or mandatory phase-out of MTBE; resist calls for an ethanol mandate; extend product liability protection to MTBE and ethanol; avoid unnecessary changes in fuel specifications, including boutique fuels; take steps to increase natural gas production and supply; and ensure the continued viability of combined heat and power systems as the electricity industry transitions to a more competitive model. NPRA urges you again today to enact comprehensive energy legislation that incorporates our proposals. We realize that the House of Representatives has acted boldly and with conviction in passing H.R. 6 on at least 3 separate occasions. Unfortunately, enactment of comprehensive energy legislation remains elusive. NPRA members hope that this subcommittee, the full committee and the House will again take the lead on this crucial legislative initiative by passing once again the fuels provisions of the H.R. 6 conference report, as currently proposed in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. NPRA would like to review our specific recommendations in more detail:

A. Transportation Fuels 1. Repeal The 2% RFG Oxygenation Requirement, Fuel Producers Need More Flexibility Repeal of the 2% by weight RFG oxygenation requirement [Clean Air Act section 211(k)] is key to provide refiners with more flexibility to meet supply and air quality requirements, and is the lynchpin for other much-needed modifications to the fuels provisions of the Act. Elimination of the 2% requirement will give refiners increased flexibility to deal with changing market conditions. It will also permit them to blend gasoline to meet the standards for reformulated gasoline more efficiently and economically, without mandated oxygenate content. NPRA also supports the petitions filed by the states of California and New York to waive the existing 2% RFG oxygenation requirement pending enactment of a federal repeal. We urge this subcommittee to monitor closely the EPA response to these petitions, which are long overdue for final approval.

2. Avoid Fuel Bans--They reduce supply. NPRA remains concerned about proposals to ban MTBE nationally or to mandate a national phase-down of MTBE. MTBE elimination may cause a significant reduction in some gasoline volumes when fully implemented. (MTBE provides over 10% of RFG volume in many RFG areas.) NPRA is concerned about the possible impact of such policies on gasoline supply and manufacturing costs. The supply and demand balance in the nation's gasoline market is increasingly tight. Supply and price can be affected by weather, unforeseen outages, and accidents, resulting in economic losses and negative public reaction, and we are seeing this happen with increasing frequency. EIA predicted that an MTBE ban could raise the national average price of RFG in 2006 by several cents per gallon and reduce supply. (``Supply Impacts of an MTBE Ban,'' EIA, September 2002) Recent experience in the gasoline market suggests that such significant changes should be made only with an abundance of caution, and with full disclosure to the public regarding any possible supply and cost impacts. At a minimum, prudence requires much deliberation and thought before acting to reduce gasoline supplies. EIA noted in a presentation in October 2003: ``MTBE is a very clean component from an air emission standpoint. It contains oxygen and has no sulfur, no aromatics, no olefins and an RVP that is very close to the RVP of the remaining gasoline components.'' The author also wrote: ``What is not appreciated by many people outside of the petroleum business, is that losing MTBE is more than just losing the volumes of this blending component . . . no other hydrocarbon or oxygenate equals the emission and engine performance characteristics of MTBE. Hence, losing a barrel of MTBE results in losing more than a barrel of gasoline production. When you remove a clean, high performance gasoline stream from the gasoline pool, it is difficult to find material to replace its volume and quality contributions.'' (EIA, J. Shore, ``Supply Impact of Losing MTBE &amp; Using Ethanol,'' October 2002, pp. 10, 12) Recent EIA studies confirm that elimination of MTBE could also affect many refiners' abilities to comply with the Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSAT) rule, which requires refiners to maintain their average 1998-2000 gasoline toxic emission performance levels. The result might be that some refineries would have to reduce their production of RFG to achieve compliance. Exacerbating the MSAT problem is EPA's recent announcement that it will propose revisions to the MSAT rules that will further alter gasoline composition and emissions.

3. Resist Calls for an Ethanol Mandate--Avoid Added Cost and Complications Many NPRA members already use large volumes of ethanol, and they expect to increase their ethanol usage in the years ahead. EIA and other policy analysts also predict a significant increase in ethanol markets in coming years, without a mandate. Thus, given the relative scarcity of quality gasoline blend stocks, ethanol has a bright future without any need to resort to the dubious policy of a national ethanol mandate. As a state that is at the forefront of fuel specifications, California has experienced and continues to experience problems with bans and mandates. According to the California Energy Commission (CEC), the state substantially overestimated the cost of addressing the perceived MTBE water problem ($1.5 billion vs. $200 million), while it substantially underestimated the costs of replacing MTBE with ethanol in gasoline ($400 million vs. $1.6 billion). Further, a September 2004 study from the California Air Resources Board and the Auto industry confirms that the permeation effects from ethanol blended fuels are 65% greater than from fuels with MTBE. For California, this translates into significant additional VOC emissions to the atmosphere. Refiners have worked with ethanol suppliers and other stakeholders to achieve a transition to ethanol use as smoothly as possible given the magnitude of the RFG markets in California, New York and Connecticut. NPRA views ethanol as a valuable gasoline blendstock, and we are certain that significant quantities of the product--quantities much larger than today's record use--will be required to meet the ever- increasing demand of the motoring public in the years to come. This means that a mandate will only increase the cost of material that would have been used in any case. NPRA requests that economic and environmental considerations be allowed to dictate the quantity and geographic location of ethanol's use. Mandates (and bans) are inefficient and costly mechanisms that only serve to distort true marketplace dynamics and inhibit innovation. NPRA urges the committee to make a clean break with the market intervention theory typified by both the existing 2% requirement and calls for an ethanol mandate to replace it.

4. Support Limited Liability Protection for Mandated Fuel Components The Energy Policy Act of 2005 contains a narrow provision that (1) would disallow suits against the manufacturer of fuel containing MTBE or a renewable fuel, (2) only on a claim that the product is defective, (3) if that product is made and used as intended and as approved by EPA. This provision preserves other causes of action, such as negligence, trespass, breach of warranty, breach of contract, and public nuisance. The provision does not affect liability under federal and state environment laws and therefore would not affect a responsible party's obligation for response, remediation, and clean up. The Act includes the same limited liability provision for both MTBE and renewable fuels. This provision merely provides fair treatment. In 1990, Congress established the Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) program mandating the use of oxygenates in gasoline in cities with the worst U.S. air quality. The authors of the bill acknowledged on the floor of the House and Senate that fuel manufacturers would have to use significant volumes of MTBE to comply with this federal requirement. EPA also approved the use of MTBE as a fuel additive. Despite this compelling evidence of the intent of Congress and the approval of the key regulatory agency, some manufacturers are now being sued just because they use MTBE as an additive in gasoline. Yet this use is exactly what Congress mandated some 14 years ago and EPA approved. The provision disallows only a defective product claim. Under a defective product claim, a defendant can be found liable simply by making a product for sale, even if he exercised proper care. Thus, by adding a defective product count to a lawsuit, the plaintiff can bypass all the usual legal requirements to establish wrongdoing. The limited liability provision only affects manufacturer liability under this extraordinary defective product claim. It says suppliers cannot be sued under a defective product claim for simply transporting, distributing, or selling gasoline containing MTBE or a renewable fuel, just as intended by Congress and approved by EPA. Many legal causes of action remain available if gasoline with MTBE or ethanol is mismanaged. For example, if any such gasoline is spilled or leaked, those responsible remain liable for legal action under classic tort theories such as negligence, trespass, breach of warranty, breach of contract, and public nuisance. Elimination of the defective product claim will not affect cleanup. In fact, litigation is the least effective way to achieve groundwater cleanup. The vast majority of cleanups are initiated with no a need for litigation. Further, the Act provides an additional $800 million to clean up of leaks and spills of fuel containing MTBE or ethanol in those few cases in which responsible parties cannot be identified. Once again, the Energy Policy Act's fuel additive limited liability provision simply removes a cause of action that results in a suit against manufacturers for doing properly exactly what Congress intended them to do. It is based on fundamental fairness and common sense.

5. Avoid Unnecessary Changes in Fuel Specifications The refining industry faces significant investment requirements--on the order of $20 billion this decade--to comply with regulations to improve the environmental performance of both gasoline and diesel fuel in coming years. Significant additional investments will also be required to respond to regulations affecting facilities. NPRA urges the subcommittee and committee to avoid any additional fuel specification changes while work is in progress to comply with the existing requirements. Particular care should be used in responding to calls to address ``boutique fuel'' gasoline programs. In many cases these programs represent a local area's attempt to address its own air quality needs in a more cost-effective way than with reformulated gasoline. NPRA welcomes further study of the ``boutique fuels'' phenomenon, but urges members of the committee to resist imposition of boutique fuels limitations. The practical effect of regulating boutique fuels is to deny state and local governments a way to meet stringent environmental requirements in the most cost effective manner. The Boutique Fuels provisions in the Act stipulate that EPA and DOE perform a comprehensive analysis of the impact of state requests for specialized fuels on (1) air quality, (2) the overall number of boutique fuels, and (3) fuel availability and cost. The bill also requires recommended legislative changes to be submitted to Congress within 18 months. NPRA believes the Act's language to be a prudent approach. U.S. gasoline and diesel fuel specifications are currently undergoing substantial modifications as a result of several regulatory programs, as well as other changes that will result with final enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. These new programs, including repeal of the 2% oxygenate requirement, will effectively address the boutique fuels issue.

B. Balancing Natural Gas Supply and Demand America's standard of living and overall economic health are closely linked to the need for adequate supplies of energy at reasonable prices. Our nation currently faces severe challenges as it strives to balance ever-increasing energy demands from all consuming sectors, largely due to contradictory and short-sighted policies that have limited supply of many forms of energy. This is especially the case with domestic natural gas production. Our national policy actually discourages domestic gas production while encouraging increased U.S. consumption!

In recent years, domestic demand for natural gas has substantially increased, while production has recently decreased. Our experience with volatile natural gas prices and short supplies over the last several winters was a reality check for the nation's flawed policies, and we must act now to correct that situation. Government, industry, and other private experts agree that natural gas demand is expected to rise by the year 2020 by as much as 60% over today's levels. But it is still unclear whether and to what extent domestic gas production will be allowed to increase to satisfy as much as possible of this new demand from U.S. sources. Current policies discourage U.S. gas production and supply in several ways. But two aspects are most significant. Federal policy has:

limited access to federal lands and thus reduced the number of places where gas may be produced, while at the same time encouraging more gas use as a cleaner burning fuel; and it has imposed restrictive regulations that discourage investment in pipelines needed to bring new gas to market; There is, on the other hand, some good news. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the U.S. has 1,400 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable natural gas resources. Thus, the U.S. is not running out of gas; it is just running out of places where industry is allowed to look for it. Further and NPRA believes most telling, the U.S. is the only developed country that prohibits much off-shore exploration and development of natural gas. U.S. energy policy should encourage greater access and development opportunities on onshore public lands as well as those on the Outer Continental Shelf. New and promising domestic areas for development must also be open for exploration and production. An Alaskan natural gas pipeline should be built to tap more gas and transport it to the lower 48 states as soon as economically feasible. For all these reasons, NPRA urges this Committee and the Resources Committee to review the natural gas situation. NPRA recommends that particular attention be paid to the following:

Timely issuance of leases and permits--DOI has indicated that over 1,000 various stipulations impede resource development on federal lands. Federal agencies should be required to update resource management plans and to process environmental reviews of proposed natural gas pipelines and drilling programs in a timely, efficient manner. Federal lands should be leased for multi-purpose uses, including natural resource production and required infrastructure improvements--All too often and especially in the Rocky Mountain region, these lands are systematically placed off- limits for development through unnecessary and increasingly stringent restrictions. The Energy Policy &amp; Conservation Act (EPCA) of 2000 should mandate a second phase that would promote additional onshore leasing-- Issued in 2003, the Phase I study identified and assessed resource estimates and outlined the impediments to development in five onshore basins. Congress should require a Phase II project that will investigate the post-sale impediments to development of the areas/resources. There is also a problem on the demand side of the equation. For too long, the impact of environmental legislation and/or regulations on natural gas supply have had little or no consideration when these policies are developed. This has resulted in programs which encourage increased gas use--mostly in the generation of both base and peak-load electricity--because of its environmental benefits. This has led to (and will most likely continue to exacerbate) higher gas prices and volatility. In fact, EIA reports that demand by electricity generators is expected to account for 30% of total natural gas consumption in 2025. This equates to a doubling of gas use by the utility sector over current demand. If present policies continue, it is clear that adequate supplies will not be available to accommodate this demand figure unless current natural gas users in core industries are forced to switch fuels, close, or relocate operations to a more favorable supply situation outside of the U.S. In the process, we will lose billions of dollars in economic benefit to the U.S. economy along with many thousands of well-paying jobs. The domestic petrochemical industry relies upon natural gas and natural gas liquids as feedstocks. About 70% of U.S. petrochemical manufacturers use natural gas liquids as feedstocks. In contrast, about 70% of petrochemical producers in Western Europe and Asia use naphtha an oil product, as a feedstock. The U.S. has generally maintained a reasonable-cost feedstock position relative to its competitors in Europe and Asia. However, that situation has eroded as the price of natural gas has increased due to supply concerns. North American natural gas and natural gas liquids prices have risen and placed a significant portion of the domestic petrochemical industry at a disadvantage to European and Asian producers. The Middle East countries are attracting many new petrochemical plants because their gas supplies are vast and very cheap in comparison with the U.S. Chemical product exports are usually significant contributors to U.S. trade receipts. Unfortunately, natural gas supply concerns have impacted the already depressed chemical export market, resulting in a negative trade balance in recent years. This negative trade balance allows foreign businesses to capture U.S. market share, in part because European and Asian producers are not experiencing similarly increased feedstock prices and supply concerns. Based on the above, we recommend the following demand-side policy options be adopted:

Provide appropriate incentives for facilities with dual fuel capability to switch from gas to more abundant fuels, especially when supply concerns exist. Federal, state and local governments should encourage electric utilities and industrial facilities to use fuels other than natural gas during the current shortage where this can be done without negative impacts on air quality. Provide sufficient funds for the increased use of clean coal technology, more nuclear and hydro-power generation, and other forms of energy used to generate electricity. This will displace gas supplies for use as feedstock and home heating. Electricity generating units which use natural gas as a primary fuel should be dispatched based on fuel efficiency. Fixed cost components of existing units should be secondary relative to fuel efficiency. Emergency plans, including temporary air quality exemptions or waivers, should be developed by FERC, DOE and EPA when supplies of preferred fuels become inadequate. Review environmental regulations or enforcement actions which require the use of natural gas to achieve air quality standards. A primary example is EPA's action to require refiners and other manufacturers to switch to natural gas with no attention to the impact on total gas supply. Codify Executive Order # 13211, which requires a statement of energy impacts when undertaking certain federal/regulatory actions. These include potential impacts on energy supply, distribution, or use. Review public policy initiatives such as fuel mandates and global climate change proposals that have the potential to impact natural gas supplies because they may encourage even greater reliance on natural gas to generate electricity.

II. THE U.S. REFINING INDUSTRY

Before addressing the current state of the U.S. refining industry, NPRA wants to reaffirm its commitment to the orderly production and use of cleaner-burning fuels to address health and environmental concerns, while at the same time maintaining the flow of adequate and affordable gasoline and diesel supplies to the consuming public. Our cleaner fuels and facilities will greatly benefit the environment. For example, according to EPA, the new Tier II low sulfur gasoline program, initiated in January 2004, will have the same effect as removing 164 million cars from the road when fully implemented. Since 1970, clean fuels and clean vehicles account for about 70% of all U.S. emission reductions from all sources, according to EPA. Over the past 10 years, U.S. refiners have invested about $47 billion in environmental improvements, much of that to make cleaner fuels. In order to fully appreciate the impact of environmental regulations on fuel supply, we should first consider the dynamics of current gasoline markets. It is important to begin with the most significant factor affecting gasoline prices: crude oil. The cost of crude oil represents about 45% of the total cost of a finished gallon of gasoline. Crude oil prices have increased nearly 67% since April 2003, once having crossed the $50 per barrel threshold. High demand for crude from Asia and the U.S., plus OPEC activities to restrain crude production in recent years, are the most important factors affecting crude prices. The other key factor underlying current gasoline market conditions is the tight supply/demand balance. This is due to steadily increasing gasoline demand (growing population, Americans drive larger vehicles greater distances) and the meager growth in refining capacity in the United States. Due to U.S. economic recovery, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that growth in our already significant gasoline demand averages 1.7%. Gasoline demand currently amounts to approximately 9 million barrels per day. Domestic refineries produce about 90 percent of U.S. gasoline supply, while 10 percent is imported. Therefore, growing demand can only be met by either increasing domestic refinery production or by relying on more foreign gasoline imports.

A. Domestic Refining Capacity Should Increase To Help Meet the Growing Demand for Fuel Domestic refining capacity is a scarce asset. There are currently 149 U.S. refineries owned by almost 60 companies in 33 states. Their capacity is roughly 16.8 million barrels per day. In 1981, there were 321 refineries in the U.S. with a capacity of 18.6 million barrels per day. No new refinery has been built in the United States since 1976, and it is unlikely that one will be built here in the foreseeable future, due to economic, public policy and political considerations, including siting costs, environmental requirements, rate of return and, most importantly, ``not in my backyard'' (NIMBY) public attitudes. U.S. refining capacity has increased slightly in recent years, but it has become increasingly difficult to keep pace with the growth in demand for petroleum products. New refineries have not been built, but refiners have increased capacity at existing sites to offset the impact of capacity lost elsewhere due to refinery closures. It has now become harder to add capacity at existing sites due in part to more stringent environmental regulations. Proposed capacity expansions can often become difficult and contentious at the state and local level, even when necessary to produce cleaner fuels pursuant to regulatory requirements. We hope that policymakers will recognize the importance of domestic refining capacity expansions to the success of the nation's environmental policies, and help inform the public of the need for these facility improvements. Domestic refiners do not produce all of the transportation fuels needed to meet the demand of the nation's consumers. On average, about 10% of the demand volume is imported, either as finished product or as blending components that can be added to the gasoline and diesel pool. The current level of U.S. refinery capacity, resulting from lack of new construction but with some expansion at existing facilities, will result in a need to import ever-increasing volumes of transportation fuels from foreign refineries.

B. The National Petroleum Council Refinery Study Recommendations With these circumstances as a backdrop, the Secretary of Energy, in June 2004, requested that the National Petroleum Council (NPC) a key advisory group, provide advice on issues surrounding domestic refining capacity, product imports, and inventories. The Secretary requested that the Council's advice be provided on an expedited schedule and a final report was presented to the Secretary in December 2004. NPRA was one participant among many in the study group. The NPC review of refining and inventory issues presents observations on petroleum product supply and a response to the Secretary's request for advice on both refining and inventory issues. It is intended to update the 1998 and 2000 NPC reports on these subjects. The report provides insights on petroleum market dynamics, as well as advice on actions that can be taken by industry and government to ensure adequate and reliable supplies of petroleum products to meet the energy and environmental requirements of American consumers. The report recommends actions that, if implemented, would:

help avoid policies that hinder refining capacity expansions; improve the environment for investment in domestic refining and logistics capability; and allow the current supply system to continue to operate efficiently. More specifically, the NPC study focused on precise topics of immediate impact and concern to the refining industry and recommended appropriate actions that should be taken to ameliorate current and potential problems. These topics and associated recommendations include:

New Source Review ``Immediate implementation of comprehensive NSR reform is a very important policy step needed to improve the climate for investment in domestic refinery expansion. The NSR reforms promulgated by the Administration, including the Equipment Replacement Rule currently under judicial review, should be implemented as soon as possible. Attempts to delay or overturn the reforms should be vigorously opposed. Additional NSR reform proposals regarding de-bottlenecking and product aggregation should be issued and finalized.'' National Ambient Air Quality Standards ``The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should revise the NAAQS compliance deadlines and procedures to take full advantage of emissions reduction benefits from current regulatory programs such as cleaner fuels/engines and reduction of regional emissions transport. As currently structured, attainment deadlines precede the benefits that will be achieved from emissions reductions already planned . . . The current deadlines could result in:

Requirements for additional emissions offsets for any refinery modifications, reducing the economic attractiveness of investment in refinery capacity expansion Additional investment in stationary controls at refineries, reducing the overall profitability and viability of domestic refining versus imports Additional requirements for boutique fuels . . .''

Implementation of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) Regulations``. . . there are concerns about meeting Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) demand during the transition to the 15 ppm maximum sulfur specification beginning in mid-2006 . . . To reduce the potential for supply disruption, EPA should work with the Department of Energy (DOE) and the various fuels supply industries to consider emerging information about the behavior of ULSD moving through the entire distribution system and to consider how to achieve the goals of the program while recognizing distribution system realities. EPA's current testing tolerance for ULSD should be adjusted to reflect the reproducibility of the tests that will be available for regulatory compliance; otherwise, enforcement actions based on testing inaccuracy may result in disruption to the supply system.'' National Energy Legislation ``The NPC recommends passage of national energy legislation as embodied in the 108th Congress report on HR. 6 as the vehicle with the highest probability of obtaining prompt action on the reformulated gasoline (RFG) oxygenate, oxygenate liability and boutique fuels issues . . .

Oxygenate Liability. Congress should enact limited liability protection against defective product claims involving methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and other federally required additives. This action would eliminate only defective product claims that penalize fuel manufacturers for meeting the Clean Air Act requirements. Negligence and other traditional causes of actions for MTBE cleanup would be unaffected. Boutique Fuels. Requests for specialty fuels formulations, whether driven by NAAQS or other wise, should be approved only where such programs are necessary and cost-effective relative to other emissions reduction options . . . Repeal of the 2% oxygenation requirement for RFG could eliminate much of the incentive for boutique fuel proliferation . . . DOE and EPA should conduct a joint study of the boutique fuel issue, with participation by the stakeholders--This study should provide important information on the impact of boutique fuels on fuel production and distribution.''

Sound Science, Cost Effectiveness, and Energy Analysis ``The 2000 NPC refining report recommended that: `Regulations should be based on sound science and thorough analysis of cost effectiveness.' Executive Order 13211, signed by President Bush in 2001, requires agencies to prepare a `Statement of Energy Effects' including impacts on energy supply, distribution and use, when undertaking regulatory actions. The NPC recommends that Executive Order 13211 be made law and strictly enforced. The NPC is not suggesting elimination or rollback of environmental requirements, but rather that the cost analysis of proposed regulations should include a thorough analysis of energy supply effects from production to end-use. Examples of regulations that the NPC does not believe reflect a thorough analysis of the energy supply effects include ULSD and NAAQS regulations. As a result, implementation of these regulations may impose unintended costs without commensurate benefit . . . ''

Permitting Streamlining the permitting process would help improve the environment for domestic refining capacity investment . . . (A)ctivities . . . to review the processes and identify streamlining opportunities should include industry and other stakeholders. Streamlining should provide for expeditious overall review and a clearly defined process for obtaining a permit, with agency roles and responsibilities well-defined and specific deadlines for making permit decisions.''

Depreciation Schedule Adjustment ``Adjusting the depreciation schedule for all refining equipment to five years from the current ten years, consistent with the treatment of similar process equipment in other manufacturing industries, would have a positive impact on expansion investment economics . . . helping to offset the historically low returns in the refining/marketing business that have hindered investment in capacity expansion . . . The depreciation adjustment should be applied to all new domestic refining investment . . . The depreciation schedules for petroleum pipelines and storage facilities should be similarly reduced.''

Fuel Waivers and Enforcement Discretion ``Use of exemptions, exceptions and waivers should be limited to serious supply disruptions that affect end users' ability to obtain petroleum products . . . Proposed guidance on waivers has been recently released by EPA as a first step in this process . . . ''

Alternative Fuels ``Mandates or subsidies for alternative fuels increase uncertainty and reduce the incentive for investment in additional domestic petroleum refining capacity. Therefore, these mandates and subsidies may not reduce petroleum product imports as intended and could increase the cost to consumers.''

Distillation and Driveability Index ``The 2002 NPC refining report recommended that the Driveability Index not be changed without thoroughgoing additional analysis. To date, EPA has resisted automakers' calls for a reduction in Driveability Index, or a change to Distillation Index (Driveability Index plus an ethanol adjustment). EPA should continue this position. A reduction in Driveability or a change to Distillation Index could result in a significant reduction in domestic refinery gasoline producibility.''

Site Security ``Site security enhancement should remain an industry responsibility with ongoing risk assessment coordinated with the Department of Homeland Security, which should retain the lead federal coordination role. Refining industry participants are committed to keeping their facilities secure from threats of violence and terrorism. Refiners have expended substantial resources to enhance security and expect to continue to do so. There are proposals being discussed to include provisions for refining technology changes and criminal liability. In the opinion of the NPC, these provisions do not provide an additional security benefit but have the potential to negatively impact light product production capability.'' In addition, the 2004 report re-emphasized the need to implement the recommendations of the NPC 2000 refining study. NPRA, both as a participant in the study and whose members are directly impacted by these and other issues, firmly endorses these findings and recommendations and urges Congress to play an instrumental role in assuring their adoption and implementation. We ask that this subcommittee hold a hearing on the NPC studies at the earliest possible opportunity. We are attaching a copy of the Executive Summary of the study to this testimony.

Summary In conclusion, NPRA would like to stress that energy is a strategic commodity. The world measures a nation by its economic health, its national security, its quality of life, and its ability to develop and implement new ideas. Our nation is at a point where its future capabilities may very well rest on a stable supply of fuels and other forms of energy at reasonable prices. To succeed, we and other energy suppliers must have the support of the American people. This is a link that must be forged. All Americans want and expect clean air and pure water, but we also want to fuel our industries, heat our homes and compete successfully in an ever-demanding international marketplace. NPRA is certain that by working with Congress to enact both fair and far-reaching comprehensive energy legislation, we can begin this process in earnest. And enactment of the fuels provisions in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 is a good place to start.</text>
